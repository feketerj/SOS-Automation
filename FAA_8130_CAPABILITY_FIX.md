# FAA 8130-3 Capability Detection - COMPLETE

## Problem Statement
The system was incorrectly treating "anyone capable of producing 8130-3" language as a source restriction (NO-GO) when it should be marked as GO since SOS works with FAA certified shops.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Early 8130-3 Capability Check
**Location:** `sos_ingestion_gate_v419.py` lines 787-812
- Added early detection before category assessments
- Checks run BEFORE SAR filter evaluation
- Immediately marks as GO when 8130-3 capability detected

### 2. Comprehensive Pattern Coverage
Patterns now detect:
- **Part 145 specific:** "any FAA Part 145", "Part 145 repair station capable"
- **General 8130-3 capability:**
  - "anyone capable of producing 8130-3"
  - "any vendor who can provide 8130-3"
  - "must be able to issue FAA 8130-3"
  - "sources with 8130-3 capability"
  - "eligible if can produce 8130-3"

### 3. Decision Preservation
**Location:** `sos_ingestion_gate_v419.py` lines 889-892
- GO decisions for 8130-3 capability are preserved
- Not overridden by later logic
- Hard knockouts (clearances, set-asides) still apply

## Test Results
✓ Anyone capable of producing 8130-3 → GO
✓ Any vendor who can provide 8130-3 → GO
✓ Must be able to issue FAA 8130-3 → GO
✓ Sources with 8130-3 capability → GO
✓ Approved sources WITH 8130-3 capability → GO

## Business Impact
- Navy solicitations with 8130-3 capability language correctly identified as GO
- Works whether Part 145 is mentioned or not
- SOS can bid through their FAA certified MRO network
- No false NO-GOs from SAR filter for 8130-3 capable vendors

## Key Insight
The fix recognizes that "anyone capable of producing 8130-3" is fundamentally different from traditional approved source restrictions. It's an open competition based on capability, not a restricted source list.
