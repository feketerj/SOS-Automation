# UI Pipeline Visibility Enhancement - Complete

## Date: September 27, 2025

## What Was Requested
"Does the UI render the exact JSON outputs from each stage? Meaning if an opportunity went through a stage, I want to see what it said."

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Pipeline Stage Viewer Component
Created `ui_service/pipeline_stage_viewer.py` with:
- **Pipeline Journey Visualization**: Shows decisions from all 3 stages in columns
- **Stage Comparison Metrics**: Distribution of decisions across stages
- **Raw JSON Output Display**: Exact JSON from each stage in tabbed view

### 2. Enhanced UI Integration
Updated `ui_service/app.py` to include:
- **Stage Decision Distribution**: Shows aggregate metrics for each stage
- **Three-Tab View Per Assessment**:
  - Overview: Original summary information
  - Pipeline Journey: Visual flow through stages with JSON
  - Raw JSON: Complete JSON outputs from all stages

### 3. Data Flow Preserved
The pipeline properly tracks and saves:
- `pipeline_tracking` dictionary with stage decisions and reasons
- Individual stage columns in CSV for easy filtering
- Complete JSON responses in data.json
- All metadata and URLs preserved

## How It Works

### Stage 1: Regex
- Shows NO-GO knockouts with specific patterns
- Shows CONTINUE for opportunities passed to next stage
- Displays JSON with decision, reason, and continuation status

### Stage 2: Batch Model
- Shows GO/NO-GO/INDETERMINATE decisions
- Displays rationale from batch model
- Shows full batch model JSON response if available

### Stage 3: Agent Verification
- Shows final GO/NO-GO decisions (no INDETERMINATE)
- Displays comprehensive JSON with:
  - Decision and rationale
  - Knockout information with category and evidence
  - Government quotes from solicitation
  - Pipeline notes (part numbers, quantities, etc.)

## Visual Features

### Pipeline Journey Display
```
üîç Stage 1: Regex    ü§ñ Stage 2: Batch    üéØ Stage 3: Agent
‚úÖ CONTINUE          ‚ùì INDETERMINATE     ‚úÖ GO
No knockouts found   Needs review         Final: Approved
[View JSON]          [View JSON]          [View JSON]
```

### Stage Metrics
```
Stage 1: Regex       Stage 2: Batch       Stage 3: Agent
Knocked Out: 15     GO: 22               Final GO: 8
Passed Through: 30  NO-GO: 18            Final NO-GO: 14
                    Indeterminate: 5
```

### Raw JSON Tab
Shows exact output from each stage including:
- Complete decision structure
- All metadata fields
- Full model responses
- Pipeline notes and tracking

## Files Modified
1. `ui_service/app.py` - Added pipeline viewer integration and tabs
2. Created `ui_service/pipeline_stage_viewer.py` - New component for visualization

## Files That Already Support This
1. `pipeline_output_manager.py` - Saves all pipeline tracking data
2. `RUN_ASSESSMENT.py` - Populates pipeline_tracking dictionary
3. CSV output includes all stage columns
4. JSON output includes complete results with tracking

## Testing the Feature
1. Run pipeline with: `python RUN_ASSESSMENT.py`
2. Launch UI with: `streamlit run ui_service/app.py`
3. View results and expand any assessment
4. Click "Pipeline Journey" tab to see stage-by-stage decisions
5. Click "Raw JSON" tab to see exact JSON outputs

## Data Structure
Each opportunity in results contains:
```python
{
  'pipeline_tracking': {
    'stage1_regex': 'CONTINUE',
    'stage1_reason': 'No knockouts found',
    'stage2_batch': 'INDETERMINATE',
    'stage2_reason': 'Navy platform needs review',
    'stage3_agent': 'GO',
    'stage3_reason': 'P-8 commercial platform acceptable'
  },
  'result': 'GO',  # Final decision
  'pipeline_stage': 'AGENT',  # Last stage processed
  'assessment_type': 'MISTRAL_ASSESSMENT'
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Complete Transparency**: See exactly what each stage decided and why
2. **Debug Capability**: Identify where decisions are made in pipeline
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare batch vs agent decisions
4. **Audit Trail**: Full JSON responses preserved for review
5. **Pattern Analysis**: Identify common knockout patterns and reasons

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add filtering by pipeline stage in UI
2. Export stage-specific reports
3. Add visual flow diagram with arrows between stages
4. Highlight disagreements between batch and agent
5. Add statistics on most common knockout patterns per stage

## Status: COMPLETE
The UI now provides full visibility into the exact JSON outputs from each pipeline stage, allowing users to see precisely what each stage decided and why for every opportunity processed.
