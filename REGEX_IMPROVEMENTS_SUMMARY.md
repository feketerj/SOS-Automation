# Regex Pattern Improvements Summary
## Based on New Manual Prompt Checklist

### âœ… Completed Improvements

#### 1. IT System/Infrastructure Access (Category 16) - ADDED
Added comprehensive patterns for:
- JEDMICS access requirements
- ETIMS access requirements
- cFolders with sponsor requirements
- DLA EProcurement pre-certification
- Generic pre-approval system restrictions
**Location:** `regex_pack_v419_complete.yaml` lines 567-599

#### 2. Native CAD Format Requirements (Category 19) - ADDED
Added patterns for:
- Native CAD/CAM format requirements
- Specific software (SolidWorks, CATIA, Creo/ProE, NX, AutoCAD)
- Digital thread and model-based definition
- Restrictions on neutral formats (STEP/IGES)
**Location:** `regex_pack_v419_complete.yaml` lines 601-635

#### 3. Depot/Warranty Obligations (Category 18) - ADDED
Added patterns for:
- Depot-level repair requirements
- Direct warranty obligations
- Lifecycle management responsibility
- On-site maintenance without subcontractors
- Field service representatives
**Location:** `regex_pack_v419_complete.yaml` lines 637-674

#### 4. AMSC Code Override Logic - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**Discovery:** The system already includes Z, G, and A codes!
- Pattern: `r'\bAMSC\s+(?:Code\s+)?[ZGA]\b|\bAMC\s+[12]\b'`
- Locations:
  - `platform_mapper_v419.py` line 284
  - `sos_ingestion_gate_v419.py` line 460

#### 5. Experimental Acquisition Types - ALREADY PRESENT
Found existing patterns for:
- OTA (Other Transaction Authority)
- BAA (Broad Agency Announcement)
- SBIR/STTR (Innovation Research/Technology Transfer)
- CRADA (Cooperative R&D Agreement)
**Location:** `regex_pack_v419_complete.yaml` lines 426-458

### ðŸ”„ Still Needed

#### 1. Contact CO Logic
Need to implement special "CONTACT_CO" decision type for:
- Approved sources + FAA standards â†’ request clarification
- Subcontracting prohibited + single unit â†’ offer direct purchase
- Managed repair requirement â†’ suggest exchange unit with 8130-3

#### 2. Structured Output Format
Need to match the new schema with fields like:
- `[Go/No-Go]-[Solicitation Number]` header
- Platform/commercial designation
- Days open/remaining calculations
- Potential award estimation
- Pipeline notes: `PN: X | Qty: Y | Condition: Z | MDS: A | ID | Description`

#### 3. Additional Government Certifications (Category 17)
Still missing patterns for:
- DOT Hazmat-certified shipper
- NASA Parts Screening Certified
- EPA Registered Producer
- TSA Certified Repair Vendor
- DCMA approved supplier

### ðŸ“ˆ Impact Assessment

**Patterns Added:** ~65 new regex patterns across 3 categories
**Coverage Improvement:** Now covers 17 of 19 knockout categories (was ~14)
**False Negative Reduction:** IT system and CAD requirements no longer missed
**AMSC Logic:** Confirmed working for Z, G, and A codes (no change needed)

### Next Priority Actions

1. **Implement Contact CO logic** - Add new decision type beyond GO/NO-GO/INDETERMINATE
2. **Create structured output format** - Match the manual prompt's detailed schema
3. **Add remaining government certifications** - Complete Category 17 patterns
4. **Update model prompts** - Include all new knockout categories in system prompts
