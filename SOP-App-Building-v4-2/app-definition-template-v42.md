# App Definition & Planning Document v4.2
**Version:** 4.2 (Enhanced with Operational Discipline)  
**Status:** Pre-Flight Required (Unless "Pied Piper 1x: skip app definition")  
**Must Complete:** BEFORE Section -1 (Unless specific override)  
**Authority:** ROB has absolute override authority via Pied Piper [N]x  
**V4.2 Enhancements:** Trust tracking, session monitoring, clean code boxes, manual bridge detection  
**Date:** ________________

## PIED_PIPER_[N]x_OVERRIDE_OPTION

```
ROB can override ANY requirement with proper v4.2 format:
"Pied Piper 1x: skip app definition" - Skip entire document
"Pied Piper 2x: skip app definition, skip shape contracts" - Skip document and contracts
"Pied Piper 3x: skip sections 1-5, skip technical specs, skip testing" - Partial skip
"Pied Piper 4x: skip app definition, disable trust tracking, disable paste counting, skip session traces"

OLD FORMAT INVALID: "Pied Piper - skip X" will not work
Must use [N]x format where N = number of overrides

Override will be tracked in continuity prompt with trust impact
V4.2 tracking remains active unless specifically disabled
Proceed directly to next phase with overrides logged
```

  "document_id": "sess-123456", 
  "extracted": {...},
  "v42_session_traces": {
    "creation": "complete",

    "processing": "complete",
    "complete": "complete"
  },
  "v42_trust_level": 120,

## APPENDIX A: COMMON OVERRIDE PATTERNS

### Speed Overrides with V4.2 Impact
```
"Pied Piper 3x: skip app definition, skip git setup, use mock data"
→ Jump straight to coding (trust tracking remains active)
```

### Experimentation Overrides
```
"Pied Piper 5x: skip app definition, no contracts, no tests, manual edits OK, disable paste counting"
→ Pure exploration mode (minimal operational discipline)
```

### Emergency Overrides
```
"Pied Piper 7x: skip all planning, skip all tests, deploy immediately, fix in production, notify later, ignore trust impacts, disable all monitoring"
→ Crisis response mode (full operational override)
```

### V4.2 Operational Overrides
```
"Pied Piper 6x: disable trust tracking, skip session traces, ignore paste limits, allow manual typing, skip binary proofs, disable terminal monitoring"
→ Traditional development without v4.2 enhancements
```

## APPENDIX B: INTEGRATION WITH SOP v4.2

This document integrates with SOP v4.2 sections:
- **Section -2:** App Definition (this document)
- **Section -1:** Git Repository Setup
- **Section 0:** Ingestion & Pre-Flight (Rule Zero)
- **Section 33:** Modular Architecture
- **V4.2 Enhancements:** Trust tracking, session monitoring, clean code boxes, manual bridge detection

**Critical V4.2 Principles:**
- Clean code boxes eliminate manual typing
- Manual paste counting prevents architecture failure
- Session traces provide complete visibility
- Trust tracking quantifies exact performance
- Binary proofs eliminate ambiguity
- Desktop icons provide reliable checkpoints
- Terminal monitoring prevents stalls

All can be overridden with proper Pied Piper [N]x format.

---

**Remember: ROB has absolute authority. Any requirement can be overridden. The [N]x format ensures explicit control.**
**V4.2 Enhancement: Operational discipline provides quantified metrics and prevents catastrophic failure patterns.**
**40-Hour Lesson: Rule Zero validation prevents massive waste.**
**Clean Code Boxes: Zero manual typing achievable with proper orchestration.**
