B. Key Deal-Breakers Summary:
- Blocker: Military SAR required (SOS cannot meet military SAR).
- Blocker: Sole source/intent to award to OEM (Cox & Company); only previously approved sources considered.
- Blocker: No TDP/data available; only OEM/approved sources can comply.
- Blocker: New material required unless specifically approved by PCO (SOS focus is on commercial/refurbished/surplus).
- Positive: Commercial item/aircraft component (but overridden by SAR/sole source).

---

C. Final Recommendation:
No-Go

---

D. Justification:
SOS cannot participate because the opportunity requires military Source Approval Request (SAR), is intended for the OEM (Cox & Company) as a sole source, and does not make technical data available for new entrants or commercial surplus providers. New material is required unless specifically approved, which does not align with SOS’s commercial/refurbished focus.
