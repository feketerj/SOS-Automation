{"content": "SAR-Language-Patterns\n\nComprehensive Report on DoD Contract Opportunities Requiring Source Approval (July 2025)\nBackground\nSource‑approval requirements are a common feature in many Department of Defense (DoD) solicitations, particularly for critical components and repair services. These requirements ensure that only qualified manufacturers or repair facilities—often the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or an approved source—can provide items to maintain safety and performance. Offerors that are not approved sources must typically submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package or provide information outlined in an agency’s Source Approval Brochure. This report aggregates examples from Navy, DLA, Army and Air Force solicitations to identify common language and patterns for detecting such requirements.\n\nAdditional Opportunities Identified (Beyond Initial Examples)\nAgency/Branch\tOpportunity\tRelevant Language\tEvidence\nNAVSUP (Navy)\tInterrogator Identification in Repair/Modification (NSN 7R‑1680‑016873109)\tThe part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity to maintain quality.

{"content": "Statistics and Coverage\nBranches covered: Navy (NAVSUP), DLA Aviation, Army (ACC Redstone), Air Force (AFSC). Coast Guard solicitations examined did not contain explicit source‑approval language; most were sole‑source notices without SAR requirements.\n\nOpportunities examined: Nine additional solicitations were reviewed in detail beyond the initial examples, bringing the total sample to more than a dozen distinct opportunities across DoD components.\n\nPattern prevalence: Every solicitation requiring source approval used at least one of the core phrases (“engineering source approval,” “Government source approval,” “Source Approval Request,” or “approved source only”). Approximately two‑thirds also referenced a Source Approval Brochure or SAR package.\n\nConclusion\nThe combined research confirms that DoD solicitations requiring source approval exhibit consistent language across multiple branches. Key indicators include explicit statements that an item requires engineering or Government source approval, identification of specific approved sources, and instructions for non‑approved vendors to submit Source Approval Request packages. These patterns, captured in the examples above, can be codified into search logic or scripts to detect opportunities requiring source approval and to focus capture efforts on those solicitations.\n\nBelow are additional Air Force, Army, Navy and Coast Guard contract opportunities with clear **source‑approval** language.

It enforces hard-stop logic, matches aircraft platforms, validates sourcing viability, and standardizes outputs for BD intake and automation agents.\n\n---\n\n### CHECKLISTS AND LOGIC ENGINES\n\n**Initial Assessment Checklist-v4**\n*File:* `SOS-Initial-Checklist-v4`\n*Function:* Lightweight evaluation tool for quick bid/no-bid calls. Captures SAR, OEM, TDP, certification, and part condition blockers. Outputs include deal-breaker summary and executive subject line.\n\n**Initial Checklist Logic (v4.0)**\n*File:* `SOS-Initial-Checklist-Logic-v4.0`\n*Function:* Enforces strict assessment order and hard-stop priority. Detects SAR, sole source, data access, or OEM restrictions. Outputs include formatted pipeline titles and contract officer (CO) escalation triggers.\n\n**Comprehensive Checklist (Full Assessment)**\n*File:* `SOS-Comprehensive-Checklist.md`\n*Function:* Detailed solicitation analysis across platform, acquisition type, technical fit, compliance, delivery, and teaming factors. Includes disambiguation logic and teaming rules.\n\n**Comprehensive Checklist Logic**\n*File:* `SOS-Comprehensive-Checklist-Logic.txt`\n*Function:* Codifies evaluation flow from the full checklist. Embeds rule hierarchy (e.g., hard stops override platform), identifies teaming thresholds, and applies scoring criteria.\n\n---\n\n### STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FILES\n\n**Platform Identification Guide**\n*File:* `SOS-Platform-Identification-Guide.md`\n*Function:* Master list of acceptable vs. disqualifying aircraft platforms. All platform assessments must match this file. No inference allowed; all unmapped platforms must be flagged as \"Needs Further Analysis.\"\n\n**AMC/AMSC Bid Matrix**\n*File:* `SOS_AMC_AMSC_Bid_Matrix.pdf`\n*Function:* Decision logic keyed to DLA’s coded acquisition strategies. Combines AMC (competition posture) and AMSC (data access level) into a single viability matrix. Flags SAR thresholds, data limitations, and teaming requirements.\n\n---\n\n### OUTPUT FORMATTING AND PIPELINE COMPLIANCE\n\n**Output Templates**\n*File:* `SOS-Output-Templates.md`\n*Function:* Defines two-stage output: Quick Assessment (8-point GO/NO-GO) and Comprehensive Assessment (full technical, platform, compliance, and financial breakdown). All quotes must include page numbers and exact language.\n\n**Pipeline Title Format Rules**\n*File:* `SOS-Pipeline-Title.txt`\n*Function:* Standardizes pipeline entry format for solicitations and external RFQs. Required for all intake records. Uses five-field structure: part numbers, quantity, announcement number, platform, and action.\n\n---\n\n### EXTERNAL RFQ INTAKE\n\n**External RFQ Process SOP**\n*File:* `SOS External RFQ Process.txt`\n*Function:* Guides evaluation of non-solicitation intake (emails, spreadsheets, POs, etc.). Includes checklists for .gov/.mil indicators, platform markers, export flags, ERP traces, and part conditions. Flags sourcing risk and traceability gaps.
