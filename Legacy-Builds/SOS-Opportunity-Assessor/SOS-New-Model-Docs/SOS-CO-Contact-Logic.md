### Logic for Triggering Contracting Officer (CO) Email

The decision to send an email to the Contracting Officer (CO) is primarily triggered when a solicitation contains specific sourcing restrictions that present a **hard "No-Go"** for Source One Spares (SOS). This approach aligns with the "BD Strategy for OEM Distribution Restrictions" and the "Military SAR Opportunities - Contact Contracting Officer Protocol" outlined in the sources, aiming to "plant seeds for future contract modifications or recompetes".

**Trigger Condition:**

An email to the CO will be generated and the opportunity flagged as a **"STOP: NO-GO + CO Contact"** if the solicitation explicitly states any of the following requirements:

*   "OEM direct traceability only"
*   "authorized distributor required"
*   "OEM distributor only"
*   "factory authorized dealer"
*   Any requirement implying that parts must come *only* from an OEM-approved source or authorized OEM channel [Conversation History].

**Reasoning:**

These requirements represent a **hard limitation** on who can supply the part, rather than just how the part's history is documented (e.g., "fully traceable to OEM," which SOS can manage) [Conversation History]. SOS "CANNOT Provide" "OEM-only restricted parts (unless via approved channels)". Such clauses are considered show-stoppers, similar to a Source Approval Requirement (SAR) where SOS is not an approved source. The goal of contacting the CO in these "No-Go" scenarios is not to bid on the current opportunity but to establish a relationship and inform the government about SOS's capabilities should future requirements become less restrictive.

**Subject: Sources Sought Response – [Insert Notice Title or Number] – Clarification on Sourcing Requirements**

To Whom It May Concern,

Source One Spares LLC is pleased to submit this response to the Sources Sought Notice titled **[Insert Notice Title or Solicitation Number]**. We understand that this particular procurement requires parts to be **[Quote the exact restrictive language, e.g., "OEM direct traceability only"]**.

As a leader in the aviation aftermarket, Source One Spares specializes in providing **FAA-certified refurbished and surplus parts**, as well as new aftermarket components, for commercial and government aircraft operators worldwide. All SOS components are **fully traceable and tagged by leading FAA-certified repair facilities**, ensuring rigorous quality and compliance standards. We maintain an **extensive inventory** of both new and refurbished parts for nearly every aircraft type in operation today and operate a **"just-in-time" (JIT) delivery model** to minimize downtime. We also support ITAR compliance for exports where required.

While we understand that our current aftermarket sourcing model may not align with the stated requirement for **[re-iterate restrictive language, e.g., "OEM approved only"]** for this specific solicitation, we respectfully request to be considered should the scope or eligibility criteria evolve. We are adept at providing commercial parts with **full FAA Form 8130-3 traceability from aftermarket sources**, which could offer significant cost efficiencies and availability.

Should non-OEM sourcing become acceptable, or if there is ever a need for **FAA-certified refurbished or surplus parts**, we maintain extensive inventory and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to this effort under a revised framework. Our team is confident in our ability to provide effective support through our robust capabilities in part sourcing, global logistics, and repair coordination.
