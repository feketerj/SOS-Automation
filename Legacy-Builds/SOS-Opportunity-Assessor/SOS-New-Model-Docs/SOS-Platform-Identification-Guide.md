## SPECIAL CASES & RULES

### Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
- FMS opportunities often have relaxed source requirements
- May allow commercial standard parts even for military aircraft
- Generally a **POSITIVE indicator**

### Coast Guard/DHS/CBP Aircraft - ALL ARE GO
**All use civilian FAA standards and procurement rules**

| Aircraft | Base Platform | Parts Source | Assessment |
|----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| HC-144A Ocean Sentry | CASA CN-235 | Civilian | **GO** |
| HC-130H/J Hercules | C-130H/J | Military platform | **NO-GO** unless FAA standards specified |
| HC-27J Spartan | C-27J | Military platform | **NO-GO** unless civilian procurement specified |
| MH-60T Jayhawk | Sikorsky S-70/UH-60 | Military/Civilian | **GO** |
| MH-65D/E Dolphin | Eurocopter AS365 | Pure Civilian | **GO** |
| HH-65 Dolphin (older) | AS365 Dauphin | Pure Civilian | **GO** |
| HU-25 Guardian | Dassault Falcon 20 | Pure Civilian | **GO** |
| HC-131A Samaritan | Convair C-131 | Civilian cargo | **GO** |
| C-143A | Dornier 328 | Pure Civilian | **GO** |

**CBP/DHS Aircraft Examples:**
- P-3 Orion variants (CBP) | Lockheed P-3 | Military managed platform | **CONDITIONAL** - Check SAR
- AS350 A-Star (CBP) | Eurocopter AS350 | Pure Civilian | **GO**
- UH-60 Black Hawk (CBP) | Sikorsky S-70 | Military/Civilian | **CONDITIONAL** - Check SAR
- DHC-8 (various agencies) | Dash 8 | Pure Civilian | **GO**
- Beechcraft King Air (multi-agency) | Pure Civilian | **GO**

**Note on P-3:** Even though operated by CBP, the P-3 is managed by Navy program office and typically requires military source approval. However, based on L-188 Electra civilian heritage - good candidate for CO outreach if SAR present.

### Important BD Strategy Note
**Military SAR Opportunities - Contact Contracting Officer Protocol:**

Even when Military Source Approval Required (SAR) is identified:
1. Document the opportunity in pipeline as "NO-GO - SAR Present"
2. Contact the Contracting Officer with this message:
   - "We understand source approval is currently required for new parts on this procurement"
   - "Source One Spares specializes in FAA-certified refurbished and surplus parts"
   - "If refurbished/surplus parts become acceptable in future modifications, we maintain extensive inventory"
   - "We'd appreciate being notified of any changes to acceptability requirements"
3. This plants seeds for future contract modifications or recompetes
4. Track these contacts for follow-up when contracts renew

### State & Local Government
- **ALL are GO** - Pure civilian market
- Police helicopters, firefighting aircraft, transport
- No military restrictions apply
- All use civilian FAA standards
- Common examples: Bell 407, AS350, Cessna 208, King Air

## ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE

**ABSOLUTE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

1. **If hard stop present** → NO-GO regardless of platform
2. **If platform IS listed above** → Use the assessment provided
3. **If platform NOT listed** → Mark "NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS"
4. **If "or equivalent" mentioned** → Positive ONLY if no hard stops
5. **Never guess relationships** → Use only explicit mappings
6. **Military SAR always wins** → Even on civilian platforms
7. **When in doubt** → Default to NO-GO or NEEDS ANALYSIS

**Remember:** Platform identification is just one factor. Hard stops (SAR, technical data, security clearance, new-only) override everything.

## OUTPUT FORMAT FOR PLATFORM ASSESSMENT

When documenting platform in assessment:

**Platform:** "[Exact designation from solicitation]" (Page X) - [Classification]

Examples:
- **Platform:** "KC-46A aircraft" (Page 3) - Military variant of Boeing 767 [GO]
- **Platform:** "Bell 407 helicopter" (Page 2) - Pure civilian platform [GO]
- **Platform:** "F-16 Block 50" (Page 4) - Pure military fighter [NO-GO]
- **Platform:** "DHC-8-315" (Page 2) - Dash 8/Q400 civilian [GO]
- **Platform:** "C-17 cargo aircraft" (Page 5) - Military-unique platform [NO-GO]
