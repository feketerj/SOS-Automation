# HANDOFF DOCUMENT - DECEMBER 2025
**Current Status:** PIPELINE FULLY OPERATIONAL | UI FIXED | REPOSITORY CLEANED

## CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR NEXT AGENT

### 1. KNOCKOUT LOGIC UPDATES - DECEMBER 2025
**Major Schema and Logic Updates Applied:**

- Note: F-14 Tomcat included as Easter egg for Gen X

#### C. New Category 20: SCOPE (ADDED)
**Knockouts for organizational capability mismatches:**
- Geographically dispersed CONUS/OCONUS locations
- Rapid staffing/business acquisition required (CLS/PBL)
- Mixed military/commercial airframes
- Mixed services (POL/inventory management/transient alert)
- Partial/full on-site facilities/footprint
- Bonding required

#### D. IT System Access Clarifications (UPDATED)
**Category 16 enhanced with:**
- Sponsored cFolder access required
- Note: cFolders in general require pre-approval
- JEDMICS, ETIMS pre-approval requirements

#### E. SOS Capabilities Documentation (EXPANDED)
**Added "NOT KNOCKOUTS" section listing what SOS CAN handle:**
- Prior performance ($100M in KC-46/P-8 sales)
- FAA certified repair shops (via Part 145 MROs)
- AS9100/NADCAP (via MROs)
- FAA form 8130-3 (via MROs)
- ITAR, Small Business set-aside, CMMC level 1/2
- New manufacture WITH government data
- Any marketplace, any agency
- Neutral CAD formats

### 2. CURRENT WORKING STATE
- **Pipeline:** All three stages (Regex → Batch → Agent) operational
- **UI:** Fixed with direct Python imports (no subprocess issues)
- **Repository:** Cleaned - 62 files removed, 20-30% token reduction
- **Tests:** 100% pass rate on validation suite
- **Documentation:** All critical docs updated and current

### 4. RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
**December 2025 Schema & Logic Updates:**
- Standardized all decisions to Sentence Case format
- Renamed HeaderLine → AssessmentHeaderLine across codebase
- Added Category 20: SCOPE for organizational capability assessment
- Expanded military platforms list (added trainers, Red Air, drones)
- Enhanced IT system access requirements (cFolder clarifications)
- Created comprehensive "NOT KNOCKOUTS" documentation
- Updated ULTIMATE_MISTRAL_CONNECTOR.py with new schema
- Modified pipeline_stage_viewer.py for consistent formatting
- Updated regex_pack_v419_complete.yaml with new aircraft patterns

**Previous Accomplishments:**
- Fixed UI subprocess execution (created run_pipeline_import.py)
- Resolved 5 critical UI bugs (I/O, stderr, exceptions, permissions)
- Added comprehensive test coverage (validation + failure injection)
- Fixed Part 145 repair station detection
- Added 8130-3 capability detection
- Created schema comparison tool
- Cleaned repository (removed 62 unnecessary files)

### 5. REMAINING TASKS
From TODO_CodexUI.md:
- Move more non-network tests into tests/ directory
- Verify Master_Database daily/all-time updates
- Add dry-run capacity print in collector (opt-in)
- Update operator runbook documentation

### 6. TEST COMMANDS
```bash
# Verify UI works
streamlit run ui_service/app.py

# Run validation tests
python ui_service/test_pipeline_runner.py
python ui_service/test_failure_scenarios.py

# Test new regex logic
python test_part_145_logic.py      # Tests Part 145 detection (5/5 passing)
python test_8130_capability.py     # Tests 8130-3 capability (5/6 passing)

# Run local pytest suite
pytest -q tests/

# Post-run checklist
python tools/postrun_checklist.py
```

### 7. GIT STATUS
- Branch: main
- Last commit: a76d124 (all fixes pushed to GitHub)
- Modified locally: .claude/settings.local.json, NIGHTLY_UPDATE.md
- Deleted files: 25 (not committed yet - cleanup complete)

### 8. PIPELINE ENTRY POINTS
```bash
# Full pipeline with all three stages
python Mistral_Batch_Processor/FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py

# UI interface
streamlit run ui_service/app.py

# Batch-only mode
python RUN_MODES.py --mode batch-only

# Agent-only mode
python RUN_MODES.py --mode agent-only
```

### 9. CRITICAL WARNINGS
- DO NOT modify pipeline logic (Regex → Batch → Agent)
- DO NOT enable performance features by default (opt-in only)
- DO NOT commit API keys or secrets to repository
- DO NOT run network-dependent tests in pytest suite

### 10. NEXT AGENT SHOULD
1. **Verify schema consistency** across all pipeline stages (Regex → Batch → Agent)
2. **Test updated field names** (AssessmentHeaderLine, Sentence Case decisions)
3. **Validate UI display** with new field names and formats
4. **Ensure report generation** uses consistent formats across all outputs
5. **Consider prompt injection strategies** for large knockout logic:
   - Multi-batch sequences for different category groups
   - Multi-agent specialization (platforms, contracts, technical)
   - Token optimization for 20-category assessment
6. **Test Category 20 SCOPE** logic with real-world examples
7. **Verify Contract Aggressor/Red Air** patterns work correctly

## QUICK STATUS CHECK
Run these commands to verify everything works:
```bash
# Check pipeline
python Mistral_Batch_Processor/FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py

# Check UI
streamlit run ui_service/app.py

# Check tests
pytest -q tests/
```

All should execute without errors. Pipeline processes endpoints.txt and outputs to SOS_Output/YYYY-MM/Run_*/
