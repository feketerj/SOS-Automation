+## Operator Plan (Kickoff + Morning Checklist)
+
+### Codex UI Kickoff (Night)
+- Repo: SOS-Assessment-Automation-Tool (branch: main)
+- Read TODO_CodexUI.md and execute tasks in order.
+- Operating rules:
+  - Do No Harm — do not change pipeline logic (Regex ? Batch ? Agent)
+  - Prefer read-only tools and non-network unit tests
+  - Keep performance flags OFF by default (opt-in only if asked)
+  - Work in small, verified batches; run RUN_TESTS_LOCAL.bat (or pytest -q tests/) after each batch
+- Tonight’s scope (from TODO_CodexUI.md):
+  - Testing: move next safe tests into 	ests/ (=10), add 4–6 unit tests (sanitizer/output manager)
+  - Validation/Audits: extend integrity diff (read-only), run schema --summary, generate field_mapping_report.md
+  - Decision Audit: run 	ools/decision_audit.py ... --csv decision_audit_summary.csv
+- After each step: append a dated entry to NIGHTLY_UPDATE.md with Summary, Changes, Verification, Next Steps
+
+### Morning Checklist
+- Pull latest: git pull origin main
+- Review: NIGHTLY_UPDATE.md (changes), TODO_CodexUI.md (what’s next), PROGRESS.md/this document (status/tools)
+- Optional quick checks:
+  - RUN_TESTS_LOCAL.bat (curated tests)
+  - RUN_POSTRUN_CHECK.bat (writes decision_audit.md/CSV and metrics for the latest run)
+- Config guardrails: set HIGHERGOV_API_KEY and MISTRAL_API_KEY; optional overrides in config/settings.json (do not commit secrets); defaults preserved
+
