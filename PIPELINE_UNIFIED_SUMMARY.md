# Pipeline Unification Complete - Summary

## Date: September 27, 2025

## Objective Achieved
Successfully unified the three-stage pipeline (Regex → Batch → Agent) to use consistent assessment logic, unified prompts, and JSON output format.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Unified System Prompts
- Created `UNIFIED_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` with all 19 knockout categories
- Created `BATCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT_MINIMAL.md` for token-limited environments
- Created `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FINAL.md` for agent-specific requirements
- Created `unified_prompt_injector.py` to manage prompt loading across stages

### 2. JSON Output Schema
- Defined consistent JSON schema in `AGENT_JSON_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Created `API_JSON_OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md` for API model output format
- Updated `ULTIMATE_MISTRAL_CONNECTOR.py` to:
  - Request JSON output explicitly from agent
  - Parse JSON response correctly with decision/result fields
  - Extract all structured fields (knockout, government_quotes, pipeline_notes)
  - Return unified schema format

### 3. Pipeline Integration
- Updated `RUN_ASSESSMENT.py` to use unified prompts via `UnifiedPromptInjector`
- Batch processor now uses full unified prompt (Sections 1-3, ~2500 chars)
- Agent receives JSON output instructions in user prompt
- All stages now return consistent `result` field (GO/NO-GO/INDETERMINATE)

### 4. Regex Pattern Validation
- Verified all 19 categories have corresponding patterns
- Added missing pattern mappings for categories 16, 18, 19
- Fixed intent to award patterns (only named companies are knockouts)
- Added reverse engineering not feasible patterns

## Test Results
All pipeline tests passing:
- [OK] Unified prompts loading correctly
- [OK] Regex stage correctly applying overrides (AMSC Z on F-16 → GO)
- [OK] JSON output format validated
- [OK] Pipeline data flow working end-to-end

## Decision Flow Confirmed
1. **Regex Stage**: Can return GO, NO-GO, or punt to next stage
2. **Batch Stage**: Can return GO, NO-GO, or INDETERMINATE
3. **Agent Stage**: MUST return GO or NO-GO (no INDETERMINATE allowed)

## Critical Business Logic
- AMSC Z/G/A codes override military platform restrictions
- FAA 8130 exception applies only to Navy + commercial platforms (P-8, E-6B, C-40, UC-35, C-12)
- Intent to award to "a single source" is OK (single-award contract)
- Intent to award to a named company is a knockout
- Agent must provide comprehensive justification with direct quotes

## Files Modified
1. `RUN_ASSESSMENT.py` - Uses UnifiedPromptInjector for batch prompts
2. `ULTIMATE_MISTRAL_CONNECTOR.py` - Requests and parses JSON from agent
3. `unified_prompt_injector.py` - Created to manage prompts
4. `test_unified_pipeline.py` - Created to validate pipeline

## Files Created (Documentation)
1. `UNIFIED_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` - Master prompt with all logic
2. `BATCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT_MINIMAL.md` - Minimal prompt for batch
3. `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FINAL.md` - Agent-specific prompt
4. `AGENT_JSON_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - JSON output requirements
5. `API_JSON_OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md` - JSON schema definition
6. `json_to_ui_formatter.py` - Converts JSON to UI display format

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Monitor agent responses to ensure JSON format is consistently returned
2. Fine-tune batch model with unified prompt examples
3. Track disagreement rates between stages for model improvement
4. Consider adding schema validation for JSON responses

## Economic Impact
- Regex filters ~40% at zero cost
- Batch processes remainder at 50% discount
- Agent verifies only GO/INDETERMINATE decisions at full price
- Estimated cost: $5-10/month for 500-2000 opportunities

## Status: PRODUCTION READY
The pipeline now has consistent logic across all three stages, with proper JSON output for API integration and clear decision flow from initial assessment to final determination.
