# Unified Output Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully debugged and integrated a unified output formatter that ensures ALL pipelines (3-stage, 20-stage, and future specialized agents) output the same standardized schema.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created `unified_pipeline_output.py`
- Converts any pipeline output to your standard schema (defined in `schemas/` folder)
- Validates output against existing JSON schemas
- Writes all required formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown, GO-only CSV)
- Handles edge cases (empty data, special characters, enum values)

### 2. Comprehensive Testing
- Created `test_unified_output_debug.py` with 7 test cases
- All tests PASSED (7/7)
- Tested: empty data, complete pipeline, special characters, enum compatibility, stage mappings, evidence extraction, GO-only CSV

### 3. Fixed Issues Found
- Added default values for required fields (`announcement_title`, `result`)
- Ensured all 20 stages have knockout category mappings (KO-01 through KO-20)
- Proper evidence extraction from stage results
- GO-only CSV creation for GO decisions

### 4. Integrated with `multi_stage_pipeline.py`
- Updated `_build_output()` method to use unified formatter
- Converts Decision enum values to strings
- Preserves all stage details and QC information
- Validates output against schema

## Test Results

### Debug Tests (7/7 PASSED)
```
Empty Data: PASS
Complete Pipeline: PASS
Special Characters: PASS
Enum Compatibility: PASS
Stage Mappings: PASS
Evidence Extraction: PASS
GO-Only CSV: PASS
```

### Integration Test (PASSED)
- Pipeline processes opportunities correctly
- Output matches schema requirements
- All files generated properly (CSV, JSON, Markdown)
- Schema validation succeeds

## Output Schema (From `schemas/` folder)

### Core Fields (All outputs have these)
- `result`: GO|NO-GO|INDETERMINATE|FURTHER_ANALYSIS|CONTACT_CO
- `announcement_title`: Required, never empty
- `announcement_number`: Opportunity ID
- `agency`: Agency name
- `sam_url`: SAM.gov link
- `highergov_url`: HigherGov link
- `rationale`: Explanation of decision
- `pipeline_stage`: Where decision was made
- `assessment_type`: Type of assessment

### 20-Stage Specific Fields
- `stages_processed`: How many stages ran
- `total_stages`: 20
- `knockout_category`: KO-01 through KO-20
- `knock_pattern`: Evidence that caused knockout
- `stage_results`: Detailed results from each stage
- `accumulated_context`: Full context (for debugging)

## Files Generated

For each assessment, the system creates:
1. **assessment.json** - Complete data in JSON format
2. **assessment.csv** - Spreadsheet with key fields
3. **report.md** - Human-readable markdown report
4. **GO_opportunities.csv** - Only created if result is GO

## Usage

### In 20-Stage Pipeline (Already Integrated)
```python
# The pipeline now automatically uses unified output
result = await pipeline.process_opportunity(opportunity_data)
# Returns properly formatted output matching schema
```

### For Future Specialized Agents
```python
from unified_pipeline_output import UnifiedPipelineOutput

# When you create specialized agents
formatted = UnifiedPipelineOutput.format_for_specialized_agent(
    agent_name="timing_specialist",
    stage_name="TIMING",
    agent_response=agent_output,
    opportunity=opportunity_data
)

# Write all formats
UnifiedPipelineOutput.write_all_formats(formatted, output_dir)
```

### For 3-Stage Pipeline
```python
# Ensure compatibility
formatted = UnifiedPipelineOutput.format_for_3_stage_pipeline(assessment)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency** - Single schema for all pipelines
2. **Validation** - Automatic schema checking
3. **Completeness** - Required fields always present
4. **Flexibility** - Supports current and future pipelines
5. **Traceability** - Full audit trail in stage_results
6. **Analytics-Ready** - Standardized format for analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production** - Replace the 7 different output managers with this unified system
2. **Add Specialized Agent Support** - As you create specialized agents, they'll use this formatter
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - Build on top of the standardized output format
4. **Cost Tracking** - Add API cost calculation based on stage_results

## Conclusion

The output schema and report writing is now **FULLY DIALED IN**. All pipelines output the same standardized format, validated against your existing schemas, with comprehensive file generation and proper error handling.
