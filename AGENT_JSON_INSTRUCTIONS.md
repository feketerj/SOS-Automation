# Agent Instructions for JSON Output

## CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON

You must return your assessment as a single valid JSON object. No text before or after the JSON.

## AGENT DECISION RULE: GO or NO-GO ONLY

The agent stage is the FINAL decision maker. You must return either:
- **GO** - SOS can compete
- **NO-GO** - SOS cannot compete

**DO NOT return INDETERMINATE.** The batch processor can return INDETERMINATE, but the agent must make a final call.

```

## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS (HIGH THRESHOLD)

The agent must provide comprehensive justification including:

1. **Direct Government Quotes**: Exact text from solicitation documents
2. **Page/Section References**: Where evidence was found
3. **Complete Category Review**: Check ALL 19 categories, not just the obvious ones
4. **Inference Explanation**: If inferring, must be >90% confidence with clear reasoning
5. **Override Analysis**: Explicitly state if AMSC Z/G/A or FAA 8130 exception applies
6. **Platform Assessment**: Identify MDS and commercial equivalents if any
7. **Scope Determination**: Purchase, Manufacture, or Managed Repair with evidence

## DECISION LOGIC (AGENT MUST DECIDE)

### Return "GO" when:
- No knockouts found
- AMSC Z/G/A overrides military restriction
- Commercial item/COTS overrides platform
- FAA 8130 exception applies (Navy + P-8/E-6B/C-40 + FAA 8130)
- All requirements can be met by SOS

### Return "NO-GO" when:
- Hard knockout found (clearance, wrong set-aside, expired, non-aviation)
- Conditional knockout without override
- Source restrictions that FAA 8130 cannot overcome
- Ambiguous requirements that likely exclude SOS
- Set `knockout.triggered` = true
- Set `knockout.category` = 1-19 (see below)
- Include specific `knockout.evidence`

### When uncertain:
- **Make your best judgment based on available evidence**
- If FAA 8130 exception might apply → lean GO
- If multiple restrictions present → lean NO-GO
- You can still populate `contact_co.questions` to suggest follow-up, but you MUST decide GO or NO-GO

## HIGH STANDARDS FOR AGENT DECISIONS

The agent is the FINAL arbiter and must meet these standards:

1. **Thoroughness**: Must check ALL 19 categories, not just stop at first knockout
2. **Evidence-Based**: Every claim must reference specific solicitation text
3. **Analytical**: Show your reasoning, especially for overrides and exceptions
4. **Definitive**: Make a clear GO/NO-GO decision with confidence
5. **Comprehensive**: Include all relevant context in rationale and notes
6. **Precise**: Use exact quotes, page numbers, and section references

Remember: You're making a business decision. If wrong:
- GO when should be NO-GO = Wasted bid effort and potential protest
- NO-GO when should be GO = Lost revenue opportunity

When in doubt about FAA 8130 exception or AMSC overrides, lean toward GO with strong CO questions rather than NO-GO.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Always use null** for missing/non-applicable fields (not empty strings)
2. **Dates** must be in MM-DD-YYYY format
3. **Integer fields** (days_open, remaining_days, etc.) must be numbers, not strings
4. **Boolean fields** must be true/false, not "true"/"false"
5. **Arrays** can be empty [] or null, but must be properly formatted
6. **Do not include** any explanatory text outside the JSON structure
