# Batch Processor Output Standardization - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-09-10
**Status:** Fully Standardized

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Standardized Output Directory Naming
- Changed `BatchRun_` prefix to consistent `Run_` prefix
- All batch outputs now use: `Run_{timestamp}_BATCH`
- Regex-only runs use: `Run_{timestamp}_BATCH_REGEX_ONLY`

### 2. Three Output Formats Now Generated
Every batch run now creates THREE files for maximum flexibility:

1. **assessment.csv** - Spreadsheet format for Excel/Google Sheets
2. **assessment.json** - Technical format with full data fidelity
3. **assessment.md** - Executive report in Markdown format

### 3. Unified Output Location
All outputs go to ONE standard location:
```
SOS_Output/
  └── YYYY-MM/
      └── Run_{timestamp}_BATCH/
          ├── assessment.csv
          ├── assessment.json
          ├── assessment.md
          └── summary.txt
```

### 4. Enhanced Reporting
The Markdown report now includes:
- Executive summary with percentages
- High-priority GO opportunities (top 10)
- Opportunities requiring review
- Processing statistics
- Cost savings from regex filtering

## How It Works

### Normal Batch Processing
When opportunities need AI assessment:
1. Regex filtering knocks out obvious NO-GOs
2. Remaining opportunities sent to Mistral batch API
3. Results combined and saved in all three formats

### Regex-Only Processing
When ALL opportunities are knocked out by regex:
1. No API calls needed (100% cost savings)
2. Still generates all three output formats
3. Markdown report shows rejection patterns

## Testing
Run `TEST_OUTPUT_STRUCTURE.py` to verify all files are generated correctly:
```bash
cd Mistral_Batch_Processor
python TEST_OUTPUT_STRUCTURE.py
```

## Benefits
- **Consistency:** Same output structure for all batch runs
- **Flexibility:** Three formats serve different audiences
- **Traceability:** All outputs in predictable locations
- **Cost Tracking:** Clear separation of regex vs AI processing

## No Breaking Changes
- Existing workflows continue to work
- LOCKED_PRODUCTION_RUNNER.py untouched
- Regular BATCH_RUN.py unaffected
- Only batch processor enhanced
