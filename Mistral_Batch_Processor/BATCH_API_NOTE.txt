IMPORTANT: Mistral Batch API Status
=====================================

The batch processor successfully:
✓ Collected all opportunities
✓ Ran regex filtering 
✓ Created JSONL file (batch_input_20250904_160740.jsonl)
✓ Uploaded file to Mistral (ID: ceb58792-940a-45a7-9c63-a7f513816fce)

However, the batch job creation endpoint returned 404.

POSSIBLE REASONS:
1. Batch API might be in beta/limited access
2. May require special account permissions
3. API endpoint might have changed

ALTERNATIVE:
You can manually upload the JSONL file through Mistral's web interface:
1. Go to Mistral AI platform
2. Look for "Batch" or "Bulk Processing" section
3. Upload the batch_input_20250904_160740.jsonl file
4. Download results when complete
5. Run BATCH_RESULTS_PARSER.py to process

The JSONL file is ready and contains all your opportunities in the correct format.

FOR NOW: Continue using BATCH_RUN.py for regular sequential processing.
