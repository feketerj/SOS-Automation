## CUSTOMIZATION GUIDELINES

### For Different Project Types:

#### **Data Analysis Projects**
- Focus on data sources, processing pipelines, and analysis methodologies
- Include sample datasets and validation approaches
- Document statistical methods and confidence intervals

#### **Web Applications**
- Document API endpoints, database schemas, and deployment procedures
- Include testing strategies and user authentication flows
- Map out frontend/backend integration points

#### **Automation Scripts**
- Detail trigger conditions, error handling, and monitoring
- Include scheduling and dependency management
- Document input/output formats and data validation

#### **Machine Learning Projects**
- Document model architectures, training procedures, and evaluation metrics
- Include data preprocessing steps and feature engineering
- Map out model deployment and monitoring strategies

### Adaptation Steps:
1. **Identify Project Type**: Determine the primary category of your project
2. **Customize Templates**: Modify sections to match your specific technology stack
3. **Add Project-Specific Sections**: Include unique aspects of your project
4. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure all critical knowledge is captured

- [ ] Fill in project-specific information
- [ ] Validate all links and references work

### âœ… Content Phase
- [ ] Document current system state accurately
- [ ] Include specific performance metrics
- [ ] Record all configuration requirements
- [ ] Document user preferences and standards
- [ ] Capture all lessons learned and decisions

### âœ… Validation Phase
- [ ] Test that a new model could follow the documentation
- [ ] Verify all technical details are accurate
- [ ] Confirm user interaction guidelines are complete
- [ ] Validate that emergency procedures are clear

### âœ… Maintenance Phase
- [ ] Update documentation with any system changes
- [ ] Revise performance metrics after tests
- [ ] Add new lessons learned from development
- [ ] Keep user preferences current

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Documentation Must Be:
1. **Complete**: Cover all aspects needed for project continuation
2. **Accurate**: Reflect current system state precisely
3. **Actionable**: Provide specific steps and commands
4. **Professional**: Meet business-grade documentation standards
5. **Maintainable**: Easy to update as project evolves

### Success Criteria:
- **New model can take over project immediately**
- **No critical knowledge is lost during handoffs**
- **User experience remains consistent across models**
- **Development can continue without interruption**

---

**REMEMBER**: The goal is seamless knowledge transfer. Every critical piece of information needed to continue the project must be captured and easily accessible.
