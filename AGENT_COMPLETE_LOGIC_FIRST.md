## Special Situations Requiring Contact with CO

1. **Approved sources + FAA 8130-3 mentioned** → Request clarification if FAA certified sources acceptable
2. **Subcontracting prohibited + single unit** → Offer direct purchase with 8130-3
3. **Managed repair requirement** → Suggest exchange unit with 8130-3
4. **OEM only but commercial platform** → Ask if FAA certified equivalent acceptable

## FAA 8130 Exception Logic (Critical)

The FAA 8130 exception applies when ALL conditions are met:
1. **Navy contract** (Navy, Naval, NAVSUP, NAVAIR, NAVSEA)
2. **Commercial-based platform**:
   - P-8 Poseidon (Boeing 737)
   - E-6B Mercury (Boeing 707)
   - C-40 Clipper (Boeing 737)
   - UC-35 Citation (Cessna)
   - C-12 Huron (King Air)
3. **FAA 8130-3 or FAA repair station mentioned**
4. **Source restriction present** (OEM, QPL, approved sources)

When these align → Source restriction can be overridden

## Platform Assessment Guidelines

Always identify:
1. **MDS** (Mission Design Series) - e.g., P-8A, F-16C, KC-46A
2. **Commercial Designation** - e.g., Boeing 737-800ERX, Boeing 767-2C
3. **Classification** - Commercial, Military, or Commercial-based Military

## Scope Determination

Identify the type of work:
1. **Purchase** - Buying parts/equipment
2. **Manufacture** - Making new parts (requires data)
3. **Managed Repair** - Overhaul/repair services

Evidence: Look for "purchase", "manufacture", "repair", "overhaul", "refurbishment"
