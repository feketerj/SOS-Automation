# Handoff Archive
Historical handoff and continuity documents are stored here for reference. They capture prior pipeline states, bug fixes, and UI notes.

- HANDOFF_SEPTEMBER_* – early pipeline handoffs from Sept 27–28.
- HANDOFF_MULTISTAGE_PIPELINE_20250929.md – pre-master summary of the regex + pipeline refactor.
- SESSION_27_EXTENDED_CONTINUITY.md, STATUS_QC_CONTINUITY.md, etc. – older continuity logs.
- SOS_UI_Dashboard_UI_CONTINUITY.md, UI_BROKEN_HANDOFF.md – UI-specific notes.

Consult these files only when you need historical context; keep the master documents in the repo root up-to-date.
