# SOS Regex Pack QC Status – 2025-09-29

## Current Focus
- Completed targeted refinements to `regex_pack_v419_complete.yaml` covering civilian aircraft, FAA compliance, depot warranty, and contract-vehicle patterns.
- Revalidated the pack to ensure zero syntax errors and eliminated intra-pack duplicate expressions.
- Documented next validation steps and recommended regression spot-checks.

## Coordination Snapshot
- External QC 1 (Aegis Review Group) completed parallel sanity checks on set-aside categories; no additional blockers reported.
- External QC 2 (RedFlag Analytics) verified clearance and IT-system restrictions after duplicate removals.
- External QC 3 (Northstar QA Collective) confirmed OTA and CAD-context narrowing meets scoring expectations.

## Pending / Upcoming
- Execute regression tests on representative GO opportunities to validate tightened civilian aircraft triggers.
- Refresh downstream analytics dashboards to reflect updated category weights and counts.
- Schedule follow-up sync with external QCs post-regression to consolidate findings.
