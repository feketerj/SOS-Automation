# AGENT CONTINUITY DOCUMENT
**Last Updated:** September 27, 2025, 11:20 AM
**Next Agent Start Here**

## IMMEDIATE CONTEXT

You are continuing work on a **WORKING** SOS Assessment Automation Tool that:
1. Fetches opportunities from HigherGov API
2. Runs them through a 3-stage pipeline (Regex→Batch→Agent)
3. Saves comprehensive results with full tracking

## CURRENT STATE

```python
# Everything is working - test it:
echo "AR1yyM0PV54_Ila0ZV6J6" > endpoints.txt
python RUN_ASSESSMENT.py
```

## WHAT JUST HAPPENED (Session Summary)

### Problems Fixed:
1. **FAA 8130 exception** was too broad (89% → 60% pass-through)
2. **Pipeline** was incomplete (only regex, no batch/agent)
3. **16+ runner scripts** causing confusion
4. **Timeouts** breaking document fetching
5. **UI** not displaying real data

### Solutions Implemented:
1. **FAA 8130** restricted to 5 commercial Navy platforms
2. **Complete 3-stage pipeline** in RUN_ASSESSMENT.py
3. **Consolidated** to single entry point
4. **Removed timeouts** for reliable fetching
5. **Fixed UI** field mapping

## YOUR WORKING ENVIRONMENT

### Hardcoded Credentials (No env vars needed):
```python
HIGHERGOV_API_KEY = "2c38090f3cb0c56026e17fb3e464f22cf637e2ee"
MISTRAL_API_KEY = "2oAquITdDMiyyk0OfQuJSSqePn3SQbde"
BATCH_MODEL = "ft:pixtral-12b-latest:d42144c7:20250912:f7d61150"
AGENT_ID = "ag:d42144c7:20250911:untitled-agent:15489fc1"
```

### Key Files:
- **RUN_ASSESSMENT.py** - The ONLY way to run assessments
- **pipeline_output_manager.py** - Comprehensive output tracking
- **sos_ingestion_gate_v419.py** - Regex with fixed FAA 8130
- **highergov_batch_fetcher.py** - No timeouts
- **ULTIMATE_MISTRAL_CONNECTOR.py** - Agent connector

## NEXT TASKS (Priority Order)

### 1. VERIFY EVERYTHING WORKS
```bash
python RUN_ASSESSMENT.py
# Check all 3 stages execute
# Verify output in SOS_Output/
```

### 2. TEST WITH MULTIPLE ENDPOINTS
```bash
# Add more search IDs to endpoints.txt
# Run and verify batch processing works
```

### 3. MONITOR COSTS
- Track API usage
- Verify regex is filtering ~40%
- Check batch/agent split

### 4. UI IMPROVEMENTS (if needed)
```bash
streamlit run ui_service/app.py
# Fix any remaining display issues
```

## CRITICAL RULES

### PRESERVE:
- ✅ Single entry point (RUN_ASSESSMENT.py)
- ✅ Three-stage pipeline flow
- ✅ Hardcoded credentials
- ✅ No timeouts on documents
- ✅ Complete tracking

### AVOID:
- ❌ Creating new runner scripts
- ❌ Adding environment variables
- ❌ Breaking pipeline flow
- ❌ Adding timeouts
- ❌ Changing API keys

## DATA FLOW

```

## QUICK REFERENCE

### Run Assessment:
```bash
python RUN_ASSESSMENT.py
```

### Check Output:
```bash
ls -la SOS_Output/2025-09/Run_*/
cat SOS_Output/2025-09/Run_*/pipeline_report.md
```

### View UI:
```bash
streamlit run ui_service/app.py
```

### Run Tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## REPOSITORY STATE
