# Handoff Documentation: Multi-Stage Pipeline Implementation
**Date:** September 29, 2025
**Status:** Ready for continuation after new model training

## Session Summary

### Work Completed Today

#### 1. Regex Pattern Fixes (COMPLETE)
- Fixed duplicate categories (amc_amsc_patterns, sar_patterns, it_system_patterns, depot_patterns)
- Added missing patterns from REGEX_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md:
  - IT System access patterns (Category 16)
  - Native CAD format patterns (Category 19)
  - Depot/Warranty obligation patterns (Category 18)
- Verified AMSC override logic includes Z, G, A codes at weight -95
- Updated metadata with scoring_engine: "weighted" and correct category count (57)
- Fixed incumbent_advantage weight from 95 to 80 (needs to be overwhelming)
- Removed C-folder pattern (they're fine unless sponsored access required)

#### 2. Current Regex Pack Status
- **Version:** 4.19
- **Categories:** 57 unique pattern categories
- **Total Patterns:** ~659 individual patterns
- **Hard Knockouts (95):** 37 categories
- **Neutral (0):** 5 categories
- **Positive Indicators (<0):** 6 categories
- **Expected Knockout Rate:** 40-60% (up from 11%)

#### 3. HARD RULES Acknowledged
- Discovered HARD_RULES.md requiring code words "PIED PIPER" for any regex modifications
- Future modifications require explicit authorization
- Regex pack is now PRODUCTION READY and locked

## Next Session: Multi-Stage Pipeline Implementation

### Architecture Overview (from PRD_20_STAGE_COMPLETE_PIPELINE.md)
- **20-stage cascade pipeline** with paired Batch/Agent processors
- Each of 20 knockout criteria gets dedicated stage
- Linear processing with early termination on high-confidence NO-GO
- Context accumulation between stages
- Sliding confidence thresholds (99% for binary, 85% for business)
- Cost: ~$25/year for 500 opportunities

### Files Already Created (Ready to Use)
1. **multi_stage_pipeline.py** - Main orchestrator
2. **document_fetcher.py** - Document retrieval module
3. **context_accumulator.py** - Context passing between stages
4. **qc_agents.py** - NO-GO and GO verification agents
5. **unified_pipeline_output.py** - Output management

### Documentation Available
1. **ALL_20_STAGE_PROMPTS.md** - Complete prompts for all 20 stages
2. **STAGE_HANDOFF_DOCUMENTATION.md** - How stages pass context
3. **AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md** - Template for agent prompts
4. **PROMPTS_20_STAGE_STRUCTURE.md** - Structure of prompts
5. **PRD_20_STAGE_COMPLETE_PIPELINE.md** - Complete architecture

### Waiting On: New Model Training
- Current production agent: `ag:d42144c7:20250911:untitled-agent:15489fc1`
- Fine-tuned batch model: `ft:pixtral-12b-latest:d42144c7:20250912:f7d61150`
- **New models needed for stages:**
  - batch_pixtral (stages 1-7)
  - batch_medium (stages 8-14)
  - agent (stages 15-20)

## Implementation Plan for Next Session

### Phase 1: Model Integration
1. Update model IDs in multi_stage_pipeline.py once new models are trained
2. Configure stage-to-model mapping:
   - Stages 1-7: batch_pixtral (cheap, fast)
   - Stages 8-14: batch_medium (balanced)
   - Stages 15-20: agent (accurate, expensive)

### Phase 2: Testing Strategy
1. Start with 20 known opportunities (10 GO, 10 NO-GO)
2. Run through pipeline with verbose logging
3. Verify early termination working correctly
4. Check context accumulation between stages
5. Validate QC agents catching errors

### Phase 3: Integration Points
1. **Input:** Connect to existing endpoints.txt mechanism
2. **Document Fetching:** Use existing HigherGov integration
3. **Output:** Integrate with enhanced_output_manager.py
4. **Monitoring:** Add to existing batch monitoring tools

### Phase 4: Performance Tuning
1. Adjust confidence thresholds based on test results
2. Optimize stage ordering for maximum early termination
3. Fine-tune prompt lengths for token efficiency
4. Implement caching for document fetches

## Key Technical Details

### Stage Processing Flow
```python
For each opportunity:
  1. Fetch documents (HigherGov)
  2. For stage in 1..20:
     - Check if already NO-GO → skip remaining
     - Process with appropriate model
     - Update context accumulator
     - If NO-GO with high confidence → terminate
  3. Run QC verification on final decision
  4. Generate unified output
```

### Context Accumulator Structure
```json
{
  "opportunity_id": "string",
  "current_stage": 1-20,
  "decision": "GO|NO-GO|INDETERMINATE",
  "confidence": 0-100,
  "knockout_reasons": [],
  "stage_findings": {
    "stage_1": {...},
    "stage_2": {...}
  }
}
```

### Cost Optimization
- Early stages (1-7) use cheapest model for obvious knockouts
- Middle stages (8-14) balance cost and accuracy
- Late stages (15-20) use most accurate model for edge cases
- Early termination saves ~70% of processing costs

## Critical Success Factors
1. **Model Quality:** New models must be properly trained on SOS-specific data
2. **Stage Ordering:** Most common knockouts should be early stages
3. **Context Preservation:** Each stage must properly pass findings forward
4. **QC Coverage:** Verification agents must catch false positives/negatives
5. **Performance:** Pipeline must process 500 opportunities in <30 minutes

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** New models underperform
  - **Mitigation:** Fall back to current 3-stage pipeline
- **Risk:** Context accumulator becomes too large
  - **Mitigation:** Implement size limits and summarization
- **Risk:** Early termination too aggressive
  - **Mitigation:** Adjustable confidence thresholds

## Session Continuity Notes
- All code is in place, waiting for model IDs
- Test data ready in SOS_Output folders
- Regex pack is locked (requires "PIED PIPER" for changes)
- Current 3-stage pipeline remains operational as fallback

## Next Agent Instructions
1. **DO NOT** modify regex pack without "PIED PIPER" authorization
2. Update model IDs in multi_stage_pipeline.py when provided
3. Run initial tests with 20 sample opportunities
4. Monitor token usage and costs carefully
5. Document any issues in MULTI_STAGE_PIPELINE_STATUS.md
