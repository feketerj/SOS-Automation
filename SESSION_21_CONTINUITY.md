# SESSION 21 CONTINUITY - Batch Processing & Model Configuration
**Date:** September 10, 2025
**Status:** Batch processor working with fine-tuned model, investigating agent support

## CRITICAL DISCOVERIES

### 1. BATCH PROCESSOR FIXED - NO MORE INDETERMINATE
- **Problem:** Model was returning INDETERMINATE for everything
- **Root Cause:** Wrong prompt format - was using generic "procurement analyst" instead of trained format
- **Solution:** Updated FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py to use exact training prompt format
- **Result:** Model now returns proper GO/NO-GO decisions

### 2. MODEL CONFIGURATION
- **Agent Model:** `ag:d42144c7:20250902:sos-triage-agent:73e9cddd`
  - Works in production via `client.agents.complete()`
  - Has system prompt built in
- **Fine-tuned Model:** `ft:mistral-medium-latest:d42144c7:20250902:908db254`
  - Base model the agent is built on
  - Works in batch API
  - Needs prompt provided manually

### 3. BATCH API + AGENTS INVESTIGATION
- SDK has `agent_id` parameter in BatchJobIn class
- API returns "You do not have access to the model" when using agent ID as model
- API returns "Model must be provided" when using agent_id parameter
- **Current Status:** Batch works with fine-tuned model, agent access unclear

## FILES MODIFIED

### 1. Mistral_Batch_Processor/FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py
```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
prompt = f"""Analyze this opportunity for sole-source potential...
Provide your final assessment. Return a JSON response:
{{"decision": "GO" or "NO-GO" or "INDETERMINATE"...}}"""

# AFTER (CORRECT):
prompt = f"""Context: You are an expert assessment specialist for Source One Spares (SOS)...
Question: Analyze this government contracting opportunity for Source One Spares:
Title: {opp['title']}
Agency: {opp.get('agency', 'N/A')}
NAICS: {opp.get('naics', 'N/A')}
PSC: {opp.get('psc', 'N/A')}
Requirements excerpt: {opp['text'][:400000]}"""
```

### 2. API_KEYS.py
- Contains both API key and model ID
- Model ID switches between agent (production) and fine-tuned (batch)

## WORKING CONFIGURATIONS

### Production (Real-time)
- Uses LOCKED_PRODUCTION_RUNNER.py
- Model: Agent `ag:d42144c7:20250902:sos-triage-agent:73e9cddd`
- Endpoint: `client.agents.complete()`
- Cost: Full price
- Has built-in prompt

### Batch Processing
- Uses Mistral_Batch_Processor/FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py
- Model: Fine-tuned `ft:mistral-medium-latest:d42144c7:20250902:908db254`
- Endpoint: `/v1/chat/completions` batch
- Cost: 50% discount
- Needs manual prompt

## OUTPUT LOCATIONS
- **Production:** `SOS_Output/2025-09/Run_[timestamp]_[search_id]/`
- **Batch:** `SOS_Output/2025-09/Run_[timestamp]_BATCH/`
- **Files Generated:** assessment.csv, assessment.json, assessment.md

## TEST RESULTS
With corrected prompt on 3 test cases:
1. BOLT, MACHINE - GO ✓ (Expected: GO)
2. F-16 FIGHTER JET - GO ❌ (Expected: NO-GO, model needs more training)
3. UH-60 BLACK HAWK - GO ✓ (Expected: GO)

**Key Result:** NO MORE INDETERMINATE responses!

## WHAT'S NEXT

### 1. Investigate Agent Batch Support
- Cloned mistral-client-python repo
- Found SDK has `agent_id` field in BatchJobIn
- Need to understand:
  - Why "You do not have access" error
  - If different API key/permissions needed
  - If agent batch is beta/unreleased feature

### 2. Check Documentation
- Look in mistral-client-python for agent batch examples
- Check mistral-cookbook repo (clone pending)
- Search for undocumented endpoints

### 3. Possible Solutions
- Different API key with agent batch permissions?
- Different endpoint for agent batch?
- Wait for Mistral to fully implement feature?

## COMMANDS TO RUN

```bash
# Test production with agent
python LOCKED_PRODUCTION_RUNNER.py rFRK9PaP6ftzk1rokcKCT

# Test batch with fine-tuned model
cd Mistral_Batch_Processor
python FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py

# Check batch results
dir SOS_Output\2025-09\*BATCH*
```

## KEY INSIGHT
User correctly noted: "There's a difference between doesn't support and didn't give you the right documentation"

The SDK clearly has agent_id support built in, but we haven't figured out the right way to use it. This could be:
1. Permission/key issue
2. Undocumented feature
3. Beta feature not fully released
4. Different endpoint needed

## API KEY
Current: `1BPmHydlQmz81Z1edAs1ssQX3DbmW0Yf`
- Works for regular agent calls
- Works for batch with fine-tuned model
- Doesn't work for batch with agent ID

## CRITICAL FILES
- ULTIMATE_MISTRAL_CONNECTOR.py - Production connector
- Mistral_Batch_Processor/FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py - Batch processor with system prompt + few-shot

## SESSION 21 ENHANCEMENTS (Sept 10, 2025)

### 1. SYSTEM PROMPT INJECTION IMPLEMENTED
- Batch processor now automatically loads agent system prompt
- Each batch request contains: system message + few-shot examples + user query
- Fine-tuned model behaves exactly like agent with 50% cost savings

### 2. FEW-SHOT LEARNING ADDED
- 5 carefully selected examples included in every batch:
  - 2 CLEAR GOs: Simple commercial parts, Boeing 737 refurbished
  - 2 CLEAR NO-GOs: F-16 military, 8(a) set-aside
  - 1 EDGE CASE: P-8 Poseidon (Contact CO)
- Model sees patterns before making decisions
- Significantly improves accuracy and consistency
