# Schema Implementation Complete - September 28, 2025

## Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED ✓

The exact output schema with PascalCase field names has been implemented across all pipeline stages.

## The EXACT Schema (All Stages Must Follow)

```json
{
  "AssessmentHeaderLine": "[Go/No-Go]-[Solicitation number]",
  "SolicitationTitle": "[Exact solicitation title]",
  "SolicitationNumber": "[Exact solicitation or announcement number]",
  "MDSPlatformCommercialDesignation": "[MDS/platform type, NA/Indeterminate, e.g., P-8 Poseidon | B737 | Commercial Item: Elevator (or) KC-46/B767 | Noncommercial: Refueling Boom (or) Indeterminate MDS | Commercial Item: AMSC Z Aircraft Tire]",
  "TriageDate": "MM-DD-YYYY",
  "DatePosted": "MM-DD-YYYY",
  "DateResponsesSubmissionsDue": "MM-DD-YYYY",
  "DaysOpen": 30,
  "RemainingDays": 15,
  "PotentialAward": {
    "Exceeds25K": "Yes/No, reason",
    "Range": "[Inferred range with logic]"
  },
  "FinalRecommendation": "[Go/No-Go with complete justification]",
  "Scope": "[Purchase/Manufacture/Managed Repair]",
  "KnockoutLogic": "[Full assessment of all 19 categories]",
  "SOSPipelineNotes": "PN: x | Qty: y | Condition: z | MDS: a | ID | description",
  "QuestionsForCO": ["Array of questions or empty array"]
}
```

## Stage-Specific Capabilities

### Regex Stage (Limited - Returns Nulls)
- ✓ AssessmentHeaderLine
- ✓ SolicitationTitle
- ✓ SolicitationNumber
- ✗ MDSPlatformCommercialDesignation (null - cannot determine)
- ✓ TriageDate
- ✗ DatePosted (null - cannot extract)
- ✗ DateResponsesSubmissionsDue (null - cannot extract)
- ✗ DaysOpen (null - cannot calculate)
- ✗ RemainingDays (null - cannot calculate)
- ✗ PotentialAward (nulls inside - cannot estimate)
- ✓ FinalRecommendation (simple decision + pattern)
- ✗ Scope (null - cannot determine)
- ✓ KnockoutLogic (category and pattern only)
- ✓ SOSPipelineNotes (mostly NA values)
- ✓ QuestionsForCO (empty array)

### Batch Stage (Partial - Some Nulls)
- ✓ All fields populated except where inference uncertain
- Can extract dates from documents
- Can estimate potential award
- May not complete all 19 categories
- May return INDETERMINATE for edge cases

### Agent Stage (Complete - No Nulls)
- ✓ ALL fields fully populated
- Complete assessment of all 19 categories
- Detailed justifications with quotes
- Specific CO questions when applicable
- MUST return Go or No-Go (never Indeterminate)

## Implementation Files

### 1. ULTIMATE_MISTRAL_CONNECTOR.py
- Lines 527-550: Agent prompt with EXACT schema
- Uses PascalCase field names
- Instructs agent to return complete JSON

### 2. pipeline_stage_viewer.py
- Lines 256-359: Generates EXACT schema for each stage
- Properly handles nulls for regex stage
- Shows complete JSON in UI

### 3. EXACT_OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md
- Complete documentation of required format
- Examples for each stage
- Field-by-field capability matrix

### 4. EXACT_SCHEMA_VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md
- Triple-checked implementation
- Confirms PascalCase usage
- Documents null handling

## Critical Implementation Details

### Field Names (MUST be PascalCase)
- ✓ AssessmentHeaderLine (not assessment_header_line)
- ✓ SolicitationTitle (not solicitation_title)
- ✓ MDSPlatformCommercialDesignation (not mds_platform)
- ✓ TriageDate (not triage_date)
- ✓ DatePosted (not date_posted)
- ✓ DateResponsesSubmissionsDue (not date_due)
- ✓ DaysOpen (not days_open)
- ✓ RemainingDays (not remaining_days)
- ✓ PotentialAward (not potential_award)
- ✓ FinalRecommendation (not final_recommendation)
- ✓ KnockoutLogic (not knockout_logic)
- ✓ SOSPipelineNotes (not sos_pipeline_notes)
- ✓ QuestionsForCO (not questions_for_co)

### Data Types
- DaysOpen: **integer** (not string)
- RemainingDays: **integer** (not string)
- QuestionsForCO: **array** (empty if none)
- PotentialAward: **object** with Exceeds25K and Range

### Special Formatting
- AssessmentHeaderLine: `[DECISION]-[SOLICITATION_ID]`
- MDSPlatformCommercialDesignation: `[MDS/platform type] | [Commercial/Noncommercial] | [Item type]`
- SOSPipelineNotes: `PN: [x] | Qty: [y] | Condition: [z] | MDS: [a] | [ID] | [desc]`
- Dates: `MM-DD-YYYY` format

## Testing & Validation

### Test Files Created
1. **test_exact_schema.py** - Validates schema structure
2. **test_pipeline_schema_integration.py** - Tests full pipeline flow

### Test Results
```
[SUCCESS] All stages use the EXACT schema format!

Key validations confirmed:
- All fields use PascalCase (not snake_case)
- Regex stage returns nulls for fields it cannot determine
- Batch stage populates most fields, some nulls
- Agent stage populates all fields completely
- DaysOpen and RemainingDays are integers (not strings)
- PotentialAward has Exceeds25K and Range subfields
- SOSPipelineNotes follows exact format with pipes
- QuestionsForCO is an array (empty if no questions)
```

## UI Integration

The UI now shows exact JSON outputs from each stage:

1. **Overview Tab** - Summary information
2. **Pipeline Journey Tab** - Visual flow through stages
3. **Raw JSON Tab** - EXACT schema JSON for each stage

Users can see precisely what each stage returned, including:
- Which fields were null (couldn't be determined)
- The exact formatting of complex fields
- The complete knockout logic assessment

## Status: COMPLETE ✓

The implementation has been:
- Triple-checked for correctness
- Tested with validation scripts
- Integrated into the UI
- Documented comprehensively

All pipeline stages now output the EXACT schema format with PascalCase field names and proper null handling for fields that cannot be determined at each stage.
