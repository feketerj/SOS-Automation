# HANDOFF DOCUMENT - SEPTEMBER 28, 2025
**Session Focus:** Designed Complete 20-Stage Pipeline Architecture
**Next Step:** Build the implementation starting with proof of concept

## CRITICAL: What Was Accomplished Today

### 1. Complete Pipeline Architecture Designed
- **20 individual stages** - Each knockout criterion gets its own dedicated stage
- **Paired processors** - Each stage has Batch ($1/1M tokens) + Agent QC ($2/1M tokens)
- **Linear cascade** - Sequential processing with early termination
- **Context accumulation** - Each stage receives all previous findings
- **Sliding confidence** - Binary stages need 99%, business stages 85%

### 2. All System Prompts Written
- Each prompt under 3K tokens for laser focus
- Complete prompts for all 20 stages in `PRD_20_STAGE_COMPLETE_PIPELINE.md`
- NO-GO QC agent for verification after any knockout
- Final GO QC agent for last-line verification

### 3. Economics Validated
- **Cost per opportunity:** ~$0.05 with early termination
- **Annual cost:** ~$25 for 500 opportunities
- **Affordable for accuracy:** Can run all 20 stages and still be under $100/year

## FILES CREATED TODAY

```
PRD_MULTI_STAGE_PIPELINE.md          # Initial 8-stage design (superseded)
PRD_20_STAGE_COMPLETE_PIPELINE.md    # COMPLETE 20-stage architecture
```

## STAGE ORDER (Optimized for Early Termination)

### Binary/Simple (Stages 1-7) - Text matching, 99% confidence required
1. TIMING - Date comparison
2. SET-ASIDES - Exact text match
3. SECURITY & CLEARANCE - Keyword search
4. NON-STANDARD ACQUISITION - Type identification
5. CONTRACT VEHICLE - Vehicle requirements
6. EXPORT CONTROL - Export restrictions
7. AMC/AMSC CODES - Code lookup

### Technical (Stages 8-14) - Context required, 95% confidence
8. SOURCE RESTRICTIONS - OEM/QPL analysis
9. SAR - Source approval evaluation
10. PLATFORM/ENGINE/DRONE - Platform identification
11. DOMAIN - Aviation classification
12. TECHNICAL DATA - Data rights assessment
13. IT SYSTEM ACCESS - System requirements
14. UNIQUE CERTIFICATIONS - Certification needs

### Business/Nuanced (Stages 15-20) - Judgment required, 85% confidence
15. SUBCONTRACTING PROHIBITED - Performance requirements
16. PROCUREMENT RESTRICTIONS - Manufacturing feasibility
17. COMPETITION STATUS - Competitive landscape
18. MAINTENANCE/WARRANTY - Support obligations
19. CAD/CAM FORMAT - Technical format needs
20. SCOPE - Capability assessment

## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

### Why Linear Instead of Parallel?
- **User preference** - Reduces distribution errors
- **Early termination** - Save money when knockout found
- **Context building** - Later stages benefit from earlier findings
- **QC integration** - Each knockout verified before stopping

### Confidence Thresholds
- **Binary stages (1-7):** 99% to knockout, 98% to override
- **Technical stages (8-14):** 95% to knockout, 95% to override
- **Business stages (15-20):** 85% to knockout, 90% to override
- **Final GO QC:** 99% confidence to find missed knockout

### Context Passing
```json
{
  "opportunity_id": "FA8606-24-R-0021",
  "current_stage": 5,
  "accumulated_context": {
    "summary": "Navy P-8 parts, no clearance, not set-aside",
    "decisions_made": [
      {"stage": "timing", "decision": "GO", "confidence": 0.99},
      {"stage": "set_asides", "decision": "GO", "confidence": 0.99}
    ],
    "key_findings": ["Navy procurement", "P-8 Poseidon"],
    "flags": ["potential_8130_exception"]
  }
}
```

## NEXT STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (First 3 Stages)
```python
# 1. Create base classes
class Stage:
    def __init__(self, name, batch_prompt, agent_prompt, threshold):
        self.name = name
        self.batch_prompt = batch_prompt
        self.agent_prompt = agent_prompt
        self.threshold = threshold

class ContextAccumulator:
    def __init__(self, opportunity):
        self.opportunity_id = opportunity['id']
        self.accumulated_context = {...}
```

### Phase 2: Build Stage 1-3
1. TIMING - Simple date check
2. SET-ASIDES - Text matching for 8(a), SDVOSB, etc.
3. SECURITY - Clearance keyword detection

### Phase 3: Add QC Logic
- NO-GO QC agent after any knockout
- Verification with sliding confidence scale

### Phase 4: Test & Expand
- Test with 20 known opportunities
- If successful, build remaining 17 stages

## CRITICAL NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

### Current State
- **Pipeline still works** - Current 3-stage pipeline operational
- **Design complete** - All 20 stages fully specified
- **Ready to build** - Start with Stage class and first 3 stages

### Environment Status
- All changes committed to Git (commit 416d32a)
- Repository clean and organized
- Schema mismatch still exists (Sentence Case vs UPPERCASE)

### Implementation Priority
1. Build `multi_stage_pipeline.py` orchestrator
2. Create `stage_processors/stage_01_timing.py` etc.
3. Implement `context_accumulator.py`
4. Add `qc_agents.py` for verification
5. Test with real opportunities

### Key Insight from Session
With only 500 opportunities/year, we can afford to be incredibly thorough. 20 stages at $0.05 per opportunity is just $25/year - nothing compared to the value of accuracy.

## COMMANDS TO GET STARTED NEXT SESSION

```bash
# Check current state
git status
python RUN_ASSESSMENT.py

# Create new structure
mkdir stage_processors
touch multi_stage_pipeline.py
touch context_accumulator.py
touch qc_agents.py

# Start with Stage 1 implementation
touch stage_processors/stage_01_timing.py
```

## FILES TO READ NEXT SESSION
