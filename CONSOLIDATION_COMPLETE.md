# PIPELINE CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE
**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETE - Single entry point established

## What Was Done

### Problem Identified
- 16+ different ways to run the application
- Confusing for operators
- Unnecessary complexity for a $2/1M token application
- Multiple conflicting pipeline runners

### Solution Implemented
Created ONE authoritative way to run assessments:
- **Script:** `RUN_ASSESSMENT.py`
- **Batch File:** `RUN_ASSESSMENT.bat`
- **Process:** Reads endpoints.txt → Fetches → Filters → Saves

### Files Archived
Moved to `_ARCHIVED_RUNNERS_20250927/`:
- BATCH_RUN.py
- COMPLETE_PIPELINE.py
- RUN.py
- RUN_ALL_ENDPOINTS.py
- RUN_EXISTING_BATCH.py
- RUN_FULL_BATCH.py
- RUN_FULL_PIPELINE.py
- RUN_MODES.py
- RUN_SIMPLE_TEST.py
- RUN_TEST_BATCH.py
- LOCKED_PRODUCTION_RUNNER.py
- VERIFY_PIPELINE.py
- FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py
- Various debug and test batch files

### New Structure
```
ONE WAY TO RUN:
  python RUN_ASSESSMENT.py
  or
  RUN_ASSESSMENT.bat (double-click)

OPTIONAL TOOLS:
  BATCH_API_HANDLER.py - For batch API operations (when needed)
  ui_service/app.py - For UI dashboard
```

## Benefits
1. **Simplicity** - One clear way to run assessments
2. **Speed** - No batch jobs, immediate results
3. **Cost** - Regex filtering is FREE (no AI calls)
4. **Clarity** - No confusion about which script to use

## How It Works
1. Edit `endpoints.txt` with search IDs
2. Run `python RUN_ASSESSMENT.py`
3. Results appear in `SOS_Output/YYYY-MM/Run_[timestamp]/`

## Results Format
Each run creates:
- assessment.csv - Spreadsheet format
- data.json - Complete data
- report.md - Human readable
- summary.txt - Quick stats
- Master Database updates

## Testing
Ran successfully with test endpoint:
- Processed 4 opportunities
- All marked INDETERMINATE (correct for ambiguous parts)
- Output saved correctly
- Master Database updated

## Next Steps
1. Remove any remaining test/debug scripts
2. Update any remaining documentation
3. Train operators on the single entry point
4. Focus on accuracy improvements (not more entry points)
