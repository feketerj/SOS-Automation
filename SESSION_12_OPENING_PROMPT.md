# SESSION 12 OPENING PROMPT - SOS Assessment Automation Tool

## IMMEDIATE STATUS CHECK
The Mistral fine-tuning job should be complete (~4 hours from 17:45 on 2025-09-02).

**FIRST ACTION:** Run `python check_training_status.py` to check if training completed and get the production model ID.

## CURRENT STATE
- **Holding Agent Active:** ag:d42144c7:20250902:sos-triage-holding-agent:80b28a97
- **Production Model:** Pending (will be ft:open-mistral-7b:sos-v1:[job_id])
- **Training Data:** 8,482 examples with real SOS contracts
- **Integration:** Ready to swap from holding to production model

## QUICK TEST COMMANDS
```bash
# Check training status
python check_training_status.py

# Test the holding agent (current)
python test_sos_agent.py

# Run full pipeline with Mistral
python run_full_pipeline.py gvCo0-K8fEbyI367g_HYp

# Run without Mistral (regex only)
python run_full_pipeline.py gvCo0-K8fEbyI367g_HYp --no-mistral
```

## KEY FILES TO UPDATE WHEN READY
1. **model_config.py** - Update production_model with trained ID
2. **mistral_api_connector.py** - Switch use_dummy to False
3. **ACTIVE_MODEL** - Change from "holding_agent" to "production_model"

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Training completed successfully
- [ ] Model ID retrieved and updated in config
- [ ] Test with known GO case (KC-46 parts)
- [ ] Test with known NO-GO case (F-22 classified)
- [ ] Test with FURTHER_ANALYSIS case (8(a) set-aside)
- [ ] Run full pipeline on test search
- [ ] Verify CSV still generates (HARDWIRED requirement)
- [ ] Check confidence scores are reasonable

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
- CSV generation is HARDWIRED - must always work
- Regex v1.4 is LOCKED - do not change
- DIBBS = GO (surplus marketplace)
- Document-first processing required
- Hybrid approach: Regex handles 90%, Mistral handles complex 10%

## SESSION 11 ACCOMPLISHMENTS
✅ Recovered from Windows reinstall
✅ Fixed CSV generation ("hardwired")
✅ Standardized on regex v1.4
✅ Created 8,482 training examples with real contracts
✅ Set up Mistral integration infrastructure
✅ Organized 75+ files down to 3 essential
✅ Created monitoring and testing scripts

## EXPECTED WORKFLOW
1. Check training status
2. Update model config with production ID
3. Test basic classification
4. Run full pipeline test
5. Compare performance vs regex-only
6. Document accuracy improvements

## NOTES
- Training started: 2025-09-02 17:45
- Expected completion: 2025-09-02 21:45
- 8 epochs, ~12M tokens
- If training failed, holding agent remains available
- All infrastructure ready for immediate swap
