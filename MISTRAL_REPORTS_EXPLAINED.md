## YES, You Get Full Mistral Reports!

The ULTIMATE_RUNNER now captures and saves the complete Mistral AI analysis in multiple formats:

## 1. CSV File (`assessment.csv`)
- **knock_pattern**: Short reasoning (e.g., "Military-only platform: F-22")
- **analysis_notes**: Detailed Mistral analysis (up to 1000 characters)
- **sos_pipeline_title**: Smart extracted title with part numbers
- **confidence**: Model's confidence score

## 2. JSON File (`assessment.json`)
Contains EVERYTHING:
```json
{
  "assessment": {
    "decision": "NO-GO",
    "reasoning": "Military-only platform without civilian equivalent",
    "detailed_analysis": "Full multi-paragraph analysis from model...",
    "full_model_response": "Complete uncut model response...",
    "pipeline_title": "PN: 2342154-2-1 | Qty: 25 | Condition: repair | MDS: F-16 | SPRPA125QET76 | Component",
    "confidence": 85
  }
}
```

## 3. Markdown Report (`mistral_full_reports.md`)
Human-readable format with:
- Full uncut model responses for every opportunity

- Decisions and confidence scores
- Organized by opportunity

## Example Mistral Report Output

```markdown
## 1. 16--HEAT EXCHANGER OBIG

**Pipeline Title:** PN: 987654-3-2 | Qty: 5 | Condition: repair | MDS: F-16 | N0038325QH146 | HEAT EXCHANGER

**Decision:** NO-GO

**Confidence:** 90%

### Model Analysis:

Decision: NO-GO

This opportunity is not suitable for Source One Spares.

PRIMARY BLOCKER: Military-only platform (F-16) with no civilian equivalent.

The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a pure military fighter aircraft with no civilian 
variant. SOS specializes in commercial aviation and military platforms that 
have civilian equivalents (like KC-46 based on 767).

Additionally, this appears to be a specialized component requiring approved 
vendor status based on the contract history showing single-source awards.

RECOMMENDATION: Skip this opportunity. Focus resources on opportunities 
matching SOS capabilities.
