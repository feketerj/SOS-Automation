## System Overview

The SOS Assessment Automation Tool operates as a standalone application with optional cloud integration capabilities. The system processes government contract opportunities through a deterministic pipeline that evaluates opportunities against a comprehensive set of business rules and patterns.

### Primary Functions
- Ingest contract opportunity documents (PDF, CSV, XLSX, JSON, TXT)
- Extract and normalize contract metadata
- Apply assessment rules and pattern matching
- Generate go/no-go recommendations
- Produce audit trails and session traces
- Export results in multiple formats
- Maintain trust levels and enforce v4.2 SOP compliance

### Design Principles
- **Atomic Operations**: All operations must be atomic and reversible
- **Binary Proof**: Every operation produces a WORKS/DOESN'T WORK result
- **Trust Enforcement**: System maintains and enforces trust levels (0-100%)
- **Session Traceability**: Complete audit trail for every session
- **Manual Intervention Tracking**: All manual operations are logged and counted
- **Deterministic Processing**: Same input always produces same output

## System Boundaries

### Internal Boundaries
The system is divided into distinct zones with enforced boundaries:

1. **Ingestion Zone**

   - Pattern matching engines
   - Rule evaluation
   - Score calculation
   - Decision tree traversal

3. **Storage Zone**

- Processing continues with manual input

## Session and Trust Enforcement

### Session Management

Every interaction with the system occurs within a session context:

**Session Creation**:
- Unique session ID generated (format: sess-HHMMSS)
- Trust level inherited from user/system context
- Manual paste count initialized to zero
- Trace points array initialized
- Session state file created

**Session Lifecycle**:
1. Creation (trust check, initialization)
2. Active (processing, user interaction)
3. Suspended (awaiting input, paused)
4. Completing (finalizing, cleanup)
5. Archived (completed, stored)

**Session State Tracking**:
- Current phase
- Trust level
- Manual interventions count
- Active trace points
- Processing status
- Error conditions
- Performance metrics

### Trust Level Enforcement

Trust levels control system capabilities:

**Trust Level Ranges**:
- 0-24%: Single atomic operations only
- 25-49%: Outcome-only mode
- 50-74%: Restricted operations
- 75-100%: Standard operations

**Trust Adjustments**:
- +5%: Successful atomic operation
- +10%: Successful multi-step operation
- +25%: Rule Zero validation
- -10%: Failed operation
- -25%: Manual intervention required
- -50%: Security violation
- Reset to 0%: Rage trigger activated

**Trust-Gated Features**:
- Batch processing (requires 75%+)
- API access (requires 50%+)
- Manual override (requires 80%+)
- Configuration changes (requires 90%+)
- System administration (requires 95%+)

### Manual Paste Tracking

All manual interventions are tracked and limited:

**Tracking Mechanism**:
- Per-hour counter (resets hourly)
- Per-session counter (cumulative)
- Historical log maintained
- Threshold monitoring

**Thresholds**:
- Warning at 4 pastes/hour
- HALT at 5 pastes/hour
- Historical reference: 40+ pastes = catastrophic failure

**Recording**:
- Timestamp of each paste
- Content hash (not content itself)
- User/source identification
- Reason code
- Trust impact
