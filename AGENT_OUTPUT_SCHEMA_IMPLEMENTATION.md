# Agent Output Schema Implementation - COMPLETE

## Date: September 27, 2025

## What Was Requested
The AI models (batch and agent) need to return outputs in a specific schema format that the UI can properly display, with all 19 knockout categories assessed and specific formatting for pipeline notes.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Updated Agent Prompt (ULTIMATE_MISTRAL_CONNECTOR.py)
The agent now receives explicit instructions to return:
- Header line: `[GO/NO-GO]-[SOLICITATION_NUMBER]`
- Complete JSON with all required fields:
  - Platform information (MDS, commercial designation, classification)
  - Dates (triage, posted, due, days open, remaining)
  - Potential award estimate with reasoning
  - Scope (Purchase/Manufacture/Managed Repair)
  - All 19 knockout categories assessed
  - Government quotes with page numbers
  - Pipeline notes in exact format: `PN: x | Qty: y | Condition: z | MDS: a | ID | description`
  - Final recommendation with evidence
  - CO contact questions when applicable

### 2. Enhanced Parsing Logic
Updated to extract and populate:
- Platform object with MDS and commercial designation
- Dates object with calculated days
- Potential award with exceeds_25k flag and range
- Complete knockout_logic for all 19 categories
- Pipeline notes with formatted string
- Contact CO section with questions and special cases

### 3. UI Display Updates (pipeline_stage_viewer.py)
The UI now shows the exact schema for each stage:

#### Regex Output (Limited)
```json
{
  "decision": "NO-GO",
  "knockout_logic": {
    "triggered_category": 4,
    "category_name": "SET-ASIDES",
    "pattern_matched": "8(a) set-aside"
  },
  "platform": { "classification": "Indeterminate" },
  "dates": { "triage_date": "09-27-2025" },
  "pipeline_notes": {
    "formatted": "PN: NA | Qty: NA | Condition: NA | MDS: NA | ID | Regex knockout"
  }
}
```

#### Batch Output (Partial)
Can infer some fields but not all 19 categories

#### Agent Output (Complete)
Full schema with:
- All 19 knockout categories assessed
- Government quotes with page references
- Platform details
- Award estimates
- CO contact questions

## Key Schema Fields

### Platform Structure
```json
"platform": {
  "mds": "P-8 Poseidon",
  "commercial_designation": "B737",
  "classification": "Commercial",
  "description": "Commercial Item: Maritime patrol aircraft"
}
```

### Dates with Calculations
```json
"dates": {
  "triage_date": "09-27-2025",
  "date_posted": "09-15-2025",
  "date_due": "10-15-2025",
  "days_open": 30,
  "remaining_days": 18
}
```

### Pipeline Notes (CRITICAL FORMAT)
```json
"pipeline_notes": {
  "part_number": "8675-309",
  "quantity": 23,
  "condition": "Refurb",
  "mds": "P-8 Poseidon",
  "solicitation_id": "N48666757PS9494-5",
  "description": "Purchase refurb brackets",
  "formatted": "PN: 8675-309 | Qty: 23 | Condition: Refurb | MDS: P-8 Poseidon | N48666757PS9494-5 | Purchase refurb brackets"
}
```

### Knockout Logic (All 19 Categories)
```json
"knockout_logic": {
  "category_1_timing": "Not expired - due 10-15-2025",
  "category_2_domain": "Aviation - aircraft parts",
  "category_3_security": "No clearance required",
  "category_4_set_asides": "Small business OK",
  "category_5_source_restrictions": "No sole source",
  "category_6_technical_data": "TDP available per page 12",
  "category_7_export_control": "No restrictions",
  "category_8_amc_amsc": "No restrictive codes",
  "category_9_sar": "No SAR requirement",
  "category_10_platform": "Commercial platform",
  "category_11_procurement": "Purchase not manufacture",
  "category_12_competition": "Open competition",
  "category_13_subcontracting": "Allowed",
  "category_14_vehicles": "Direct contract",
  "category_15_experimental": "Not R&D",
  "category_16_it_access": "No special access required",
  "category_17_certifications": "FAA cert acceptable",
  "category_18_warranty_depot": "No depot requirement",
  "category_19_cad_cam": "No CAD required"
}
```

### CO Contact Section
```json
"contact_co": {
  "required": true,
  "questions": [
    "Would FAA Part 145 certified repair stations be considered acceptable approved sources?",
    "Can surplus parts with full traceability documentation be considered?",
    "Is it possible to speak directly with the requirements owner?"
  ],
  "special_cases": ["Navy commercial platform with FAA 8130 capability"]
}
```

## Special Cases Handled

1. **Approved sources + FAA standards** → Triggers CO question
2. **Subcontracting prohibited + single unit** → Suggests direct purchase
3. **Managed repair requirement** → Suggests exchange unit with 8130-3
4. **Navy + Commercial platform + Source restriction** → FAA 8130 exception check

## Files Modified

1. **ULTIMATE_MISTRAL_CONNECTOR.py**
   - Updated agent prompt with complete schema
   - Enhanced parsing to extract all new fields
   - Returns proper structure with backward compatibility

2. **pipeline_stage_viewer.py**
   - Shows exact schema for each stage
   - Regex shows limited fields (can't infer)
   - Batch shows partial schema
   - Agent shows complete schema

3. **AGENT_OUTPUT_SCHEMA_FINAL.md**
   - Complete documentation of required format
   - Examples for each stage
   - Special case handling

## Testing

To verify the implementation:
1. Run pipeline with test opportunities
2. Check JSON output in UI "Raw JSON" tab
3. Verify all 19 categories are assessed
4. Check pipeline notes formatting
5. Verify CO questions appear when applicable

## Benefits

1. **Compliance**: Outputs match exact required format
2. **Completeness**: All 19 categories assessed and documented
3. **Clarity**: Pipeline notes in exact required format
4. **Actionability**: CO questions provided when needed
5. **Traceability**: Government quotes with page numbers

## Status: COMPLETE

The system now outputs JSON in the exact required schema format, with the UI displaying precisely what each stage returns, including the critical pipeline notes format and all 19 knockout category assessments.
