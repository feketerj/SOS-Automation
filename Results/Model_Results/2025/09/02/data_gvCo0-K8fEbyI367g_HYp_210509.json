      "description_text": "Note:  This is a follow-on Request for Information (RFI) to two previous Sources Sought Announcements (links provided below) and is requesting more detailed information about readily available or commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions for a hospital bed isolation system to support the Biocontainment, Isolation, and Quarantine (BIQ) Shipboard Isolation System (SIS) program.\n\n\n\thttps://sam.gov/opp/d2ddfa1fb4694c4eb83a33ba50085882/view, posted 11 SEP 2023 through 31 OCT 2023\n\thttps://sam.gov/opp/9d48079a6e6f41819578ab491a4c06f1/view, posted 06 AUG 2024 through 08 NOV 2024\n\n\n\n\nSynopsis: The purpose of this RFI is to obtain detailed information to assist the Joint Project Manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Protection (JPM CBRN Protection) in identifying readily available or COTS systems for the BIQ SIS program.  The system will temporarily enclose and isolate an infectious patient confined to a hospital bed on a U.S. Navy ship to control and prevent the spread of biological threats (biothreats).\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Government requests that responses be submitted via email ONLY to Brian Liska at brian.liska@usmc.mil no later than 10 SEP 2025 by 5:00 p.m. EST.\n\n\n\nBackground: To address the goals and objectives of the Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) Enhanced Biodefense and Pandemic Preparedness Narrative and the National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan, JPM CBRN Protection is in need of a system to temporarily isolate an infectious patient confined to a hospital bed on a U.S. Navy ship. This RFI is issued to determine what solutions are available, and to obtain details about these systems to determine if they may be suitable for military use.\n\n\n\nDescription: This isolation system must be able to be erected quickly to temporarily isolate an infectious patient confined to a hospital bed in a shipboard environment.  The system must include an air filtration system to generate a negative pressure inside the enclosure, produce sufficient air changes inside the enclosure, and filter exhaust air from the enclosure.  Other features such as, but not limited to, inlet air filters, glove ports, pass-thru interfaces, and windows are needed for healthcare workers to provide care to the patient.\n\n\n\nPrograms: This RFI is in support of the SIS program, which is one of the three BIQ programs managed by JPM CBRN Protection.  Requirements for the system are currently being developed.\n\n\n\nGovernment Furnished Property: None\n\n\n\nResponses: Interested parties are invited to submit a response to this RFI.\n\n\n\nThis RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and to identify potential readily available or COTS solutions. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. No contract will be awarded from this RFI. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. It is subject to change and is not binding on the U.S. Government. Further, unsolicited proposals will not be accepted. Funding is not available at this time. The U.S. Government has not made a commitment to procure any of the items/services discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. Response to this RFI is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this and any follow-on information requests. All submissions become U.S. Government property and will not be returned.\n\n\n\nNot responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP(s) if any is(are) issued.\n\n\n\nInterested parties may identify their interest by submitting a white paper regarding this RFI to JPM CBRN Protection via e-mail ONLY to Brian Liska at brian.liska@usmc.mil no later than 10 SEP 2025 by 5:00 p.m. EST.  Please include the following information in the white paper:\n\n\n\tPlease provide system description(s) and image(s).\n\tWhat is the size and weight of the system?\n\tWhat is the cost and delivery lead time for 1 system up to 10 systems?\n\tWhat is the location of the manufacturing facility?  Are any system components/parts sourced outside of the United States and if so, where?\n\tWhat is the shelf life and recommended storage conditions of the system?\n\tIs the system a prototype, commercial off the shelf, or government off the shelf?\n\tWhat negative pressure (in inches of water column/gauge) is maintained inside the enclosure (i.e., the enclosed patient isolation area)?\n\tHow many air changes per hour are maintained inside the enclosure?\n\tWhat media is used to filter the inlet and exhaust air (e.g., HEPA, ULPA, MERV-14)?\n\tWhat is the power source for the system (e.g., rechargeable battery, non-rechargeable battery, 120 VAC, 240VAC)?  If there is more than one power source, then please list all of them.  Please provide battery model numbers.  How many hours can the system continuously operate using each power source?\n\tWhat EMI testing has been performed on the system (e.g., MIL-STD-461, MIL-STD-464)?\n\tWhat features are incorporated in the system to prevent liquids (e.g., blood, urine, vomit) from leaking out of the enclosure (e.g., leakproof zipper, absorbent pad)?  Additionally, what volume of liquid can be contained within the enclosure?\n\tHas the system been tested for compatibility with any decontaminants (e.g., Calla 1452, 9% calcium hypochlorite and seawater solution, Joint General-Purpose Decontaminant)?\n\tWhat is the minimum and maximum temperature and relative humidity that the system can be operated in?\n\tHas the system been tested in any adverse environmental conditions (e.g., sand, fungus, salt spray/fog, rain)?\n\tWhat material testing has been performed (e.g., tear strength, puncture resistance)?\n\tIs PFAS contained in any component used in the system?\n\tAre storage containers provided to protect the system from corrosion due to exposure to salt-laden air/water when it is stowed?  What is the size and weight of the system when it is being stowed?\n\tHas any shock and/or vibration testing been performed on the system?  If yes, then please indicate which standards were used (e.g., MIL-STD-810H, MIL-DTL-901E, MIL-STD-167-1A).\n\tIs there a way to secure the hospital bed within the system?\n\tHow many people are required and how long does it take to setup the system?  How many people are required to operate the system?\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:  Specification sheets, reports, and/or manuals may be included with the white paper.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the expense of the interested party.\n\n\nQuestions: Any questions for clarification may be emailed to Brian Liska at brian.liska@usmc.mil no later than five business days before 10 SEP 2025. Please allow three business days for a response. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information.

      "description_text": "Note:  This is a follow-on Request for Information (RFI) to two previous Sources Sought Announcements (links provided below) and is requesting more detailed information about readily available or commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions for a single (non-ambulatory) patient system to support the Biocontainment, Isolation, and Quarantine (BIQ) Portable Patient Transport System (PPTS) program.\n\n\n\thttps://sam.gov/opp/d2ddfa1fb4694c4eb83a33ba50085882/view, posted 11 SEP 2023 through 31 OCT 2023\n\thttps://sam.gov/opp/9d48079a6e6f41819578ab491a4c06f1/view, posted 06 AUG 2024 through 08 NOV 2024\n\n\n\n\nSynopsis: The purpose of this RFI is to obtain detailed information to assist the Joint Project Manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Protection (JPM CBRN Protection) in identifying readily available or COTS solutions for a single (non-ambulatory) patient system to support the BIQ PPTS program. This man-portable system will control and prevent the spread of biological threats (biothreats) while transporting a single, non-ambulatory infectious patient by air, rail, ground transport, or sealift.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Government requests that responses be submitted via email ONLY to Brian Liska at brian.liska@usmc.mil no later than 10 SEP 2025 by 5:00 p.m. EST.\n\n\n\nBackground: To address the goals and objectives of the Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) Enhanced Biodefense and Pandemic Preparedness Narrative and the National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan, JPM CBRN Protection is in need of a man-portable system to control and prevent the spread of biothreats while transporting a non-ambulatory infectious patient. This RFI is issued to determine what solutions are available, and to obtain details about these systems to determine if they may be suitable for military use.\n\n\n\nDescription: This single (non-ambulatory) patient BIQ transport system must be man-portable and will consist of an enclosure for the infectious patient with an attached battery-powered air filtration system to generate a negative pressure inside the enclosure, provide sufficient air changes inside the enclosure, and filter exhaust air from the enclosure.  Other features such as, but not limited to, inlet air filters, glove ports, pass-thru interfaces, and windows are needed for healthcare workers to provide care to the patient during transport.\n\n\n\nPrograms: This RFI is in support of the PPTS program, which is one of the three BIQ programs managed by JPM CBRN Protection.  Requirements for the single (non-ambulatory) patient system are currently being developed, and a validated requirements document is anticipated in Fiscal Year 2026.\n\n\n\nGovernment Furnished Property: None\n\n\n\nResponses: Interested parties are invited to submit a response to this RFI.\n\n\n\nThis RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and to identify potential COTS solutions. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. No contract will be awarded from this RFI. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. It is subject to change and is not binding on the U.S. Government. Further, unsolicited proposals will not be accepted. Funding is not available at this time. The U.S. Government has not made a commitment to procure any of the items/services discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. Response to this RFI is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this and any follow-on information requests. All submissions become U.S. Government property and will not be returned.\n\n\n\nNot responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP(s) if any is(are) issued.\n\n\n\nInterested parties may identify their interest by submitting a white paper regarding this RFI to JPM CBRN Protection via e-mail ONLY to Brian Liska at brian.liska@usmc.mil no later than 10 SEP 2025 by 5:00 p.m. EST.  Please include the following information in the white paper:\n\n\n\tPlease provide system description(s) and image(s).\n\tWhat is the size and weight of the system?\n\tWhat is the cost and delivery lead time for 1 system up to 50 systems?\n\tWhat is the location of the manufacturing facility?  Are any system components/parts sourced outside of the United States and if so, where?\n\tWhat is the shelf life and recommended storage conditions of the system?\n\tIs the system a prototype, commercial off the shelf, or government off the shelf?\n\tWhat negative pressure (in inches of water column/gauge) is maintained inside the enclosure (i.e., the enclosed patient isolation area)?\n\tHow many air changes per hour are maintained inside the enclosure?\n\tWhat media is used to filter the inlet/exhaust air (e.g., HEPA, ULPA, MERV-14)?\n\tWhat is the power source for the system (e.g., rechargeable battery, non-rechargeable battery, 120 VAC)?  If there is more than one power source, then please list all of them.  Please provide battery model numbers.  How many hours can the system continuously operate using each power source?\n\tWhat EMI testing has been performed on the system (e.g., MIL-STD-461, MIL-STD-464)?\n\tWhat features are incorporated in the system to prevent liquids (e.g., blood, urine, vomit) from leaking out of the enclosure (e.g., leakproof zipper, absorbent pad)?  Additionally, what volume of liquid can be contained within the enclosure?\n\tHas the system been tested for compatibility with any decontaminants (e.g., Calla 1452, 2% calcium hypochlorite solution, Joint General-Purpose Decontaminant)?\n\tWhat is the minimum and maximum temperature and relative humidity that the system can be operated in?\n\tHas the system been tested in any adverse environmental conditions (e.g., sand, smoke, fungus, salt spray/fog, rain)?\n\tWhat material testing has been performed (e.g., tear strength, puncture resistance)?\n\tWhat platforms (e.g., ambulance, aircraft) can be used to transport the system in the patient movement configuration (i.e., when a patient is inside the enclosure)?\n\tWhat military and/or commercial aircraft has the system been certified for airworthiness?\n\tWhat litters is the system compatible with (e.g., NATO litter, DECON litter, stokes litter, SKED litter)?  If unknown, then please provide the exterior dimensions of the system.\n\tIs PFAS contained in any component used in the system?\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:  Specification sheets, reports, and/or manuals may be included with the white paper.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the expense of the interested party.\n\n\nQuestions: Any questions for clarification may be emailed to Brian Liska at brian.liska@usmc.mil no later than five business days before 10 SEP 2025. Please allow three business days for a response. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information.
