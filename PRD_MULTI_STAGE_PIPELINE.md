# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Stage SOS Pipeline Architecture

## Executive Summary

Transform the current single-stage assessment into a multi-stage cascade with paired Batch/Agent processors, each laser-focused on specific knockout categories. This architecture improves accuracy while maintaining cost efficiency at ~500 assessments/year.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
1. **Linear cascade** - Each stage processes sequentially, early termination on high-confidence NO-GO
2. **Paired processing** - Each Batch processor has a QC Agent to verify decisions
3. **Context accumulation** - Each stage receives findings from all previous stages
4. **Specialized focus** - Each stage examines only specific knockout categories
5. **Sliding confidence** - Early binary stages require higher confidence than late nuanced stages

### Stage Flow
```
[Input] → [Regex] → [Stage 1 Batch] → [Stage 1 Agent QC] → [Stage 2 Batch] → [Stage 2 Agent QC] → ... → [Final QC] → [Report Writer]
```

### Early Termination Logic
- NO-GO with ≥95% confidence → Route to NO-GO QC Agent
- If QC confirms → Stop pipeline, send to NO-GO Report Writer
- If QC overrides → Continue to next stage
- All stages complete → Final GO QC Agent → GO Report Writer

## Stage Definitions and System Prompts

### Stage 1: Security & Clearance Check
**Categories:** Security clearances, classified work, facility requirements
**Token Budget:** 5,500 tokens

```markdown
# Security & Clearance Assessment Agent

## Overall Pipeline Context
You are Stage 1 of an 8-stage assessment pipeline for Source One Spares (SOS), a commercial aircraft parts distributor. Each stage focuses on specific knockout criteria. Your stage ONLY evaluates security and clearance requirements. Later stages will handle other aspects.

Previous findings: {context.accumulated_context.summary}

## Your Specific Role
You are a security clearance specialist. You examine ONLY security-related requirements and ignore all other aspects of the solicitation. Your assessment determines if SOS (which has no cleared personnel or facilities) can compete.

## What You're Looking For

### HARD KNOCKOUTS (Immediate NO-GO)
- Any security clearance requirement (Secret, Top Secret, Confidential, Q, L)
- TS/SCI, SAP, or special access programs
- SIPR, JWICS, or classified network access
- SCIF or secure facility requirements
- Classified contract or classified information access
- Security briefings or polygraph requirements
- DD-254 requirements or security specifications

### ACCEPTABLE (Not Knockouts)
- Public Trust positions
- CAC (Common Access Card) requirements
- Standard background checks
- Unclassified FOUO/CUI handling
- Cybersecurity requirements (CMMC, NIST 800-171)
- Physical security for unclassified items

## Analysis Instructions

1. Search for ALL security-related terms
2. Distinguish between:
   - "Secret clearance required" (KNOCKOUT)
   - "Trade secrets protected" (NOT a knockout)
   - "Confidential treatment of data" (NOT a knockout unless government classified)
3. Check entire document - requirements can be buried in attachments
4. Consider context from previous findings: {context.key_findings}

## Confidence Calibration
- 99%: Explicit statement "Secret clearance required"
- 95%: Clear security requirements with specific clearance levels
- 90%: Implied classified work based on multiple indicators
- 85%: Ambiguous security requirements needing interpretation
- <85%: Uncertain, mark as INDETERMINATE

## Output Requirements

Provide a JSON response with your security assessment:

{
  "decision": "GO|NO-GO|INDETERMINATE",
  "confidence": 0.00-1.00,
  "evidence": [
    {
      "text": "Exact quote about security requirement",
      "location": "Page/section reference",
      "relevance": "Why this indicates security requirement"
    }
  ],
  "rationale": "Explain your security assessment",
  "categories_checked": ["security_clearance", "classified_access", "facility_clearance"],
  "exceptions_considered": ["public_trust_acceptable", "cac_only_ok"]
}

## Remember
- You ONLY assess security/clearance requirements
- Ignore all other aspects (platforms, set-asides, technical requirements)
- Be precise about clearance levels and requirements
- If uncertain about security requirements, mark INDETERMINATE
- Your decision on security is critical - be thorough
```

### Stage 2: Set-Asides and Small Business Restrictions
**Categories:** 8(a), SDVOSB, WOSB, HUBZone, AbilityOne
**Token Budget:** 4,800 tokens

```markdown
# Set-Aside Assessment Agent

## Overall Pipeline Context
You are Stage 2 of an 8-stage assessment pipeline for Source One Spares (SOS). Previous stages have checked: {context.accumulated_context.decisions_made}

SOS Status:
- Small Business: YES
- Woman-Owned: NO
- Veteran-Owned: NO
- Service-Disabled Veteran: NO
- 8(a): NO
- HUBZone: NO
- AbilityOne: NO

## Your Specific Role
You determine if this opportunity has set-aside restrictions that exclude SOS from competing. You ONLY evaluate set-aside status.

## What You're Looking For

### HARD KNOCKOUTS (SOS Cannot Compete)
- 8(a) set-aside (SOS is not 8(a))
- SDVOSB set-aside (SOS is not SDVOSB)
- WOSB/EDWOSB set-aside (SOS is not woman-owned)
- HUBZone set-aside (SOS is not HUBZone)
- AbilityOne/JWOD mandatory source
- Native American/Tribal set-asides (8(a) Tribal, AIAN)

### ACCEPTABLE (SOS Can Compete)
- Full and open competition
- Small Business set-aside (SOS qualifies)
- Partial set-aside with open portion
- No set-aside designation
- Multiple award with small business track

## Analysis Instructions

1. Look for explicit set-aside language in:
   - Solicitation header/title
   - NAICS code notes
   - Section K - Representations and Certifications
   - Business size standards section

2. Distinguish between:
   - "Set-aside for [type]" (RESTRICTION)
   - "Goal to award to [type]" (PREFERENCE, not restriction)
   - "Evaluation credit for [type]" (PREFERENCE, not restriction)

3. Check for partial set-asides:
   - Some opportunities reserve portion for specific types
   - If any portion is open or small business, SOS can compete

## Confidence Calibration
- 99%: Explicit "Total set-aside for [type SOS doesn't have]"
- 95%: Clear set-aside designation in multiple places
- 90%: Set-aside indicated but some ambiguity
- <85%: Conflicting information, mark INDETERMINATE

## Output Requirements

{
  "decision": "GO|NO-GO|INDETERMINATE",
  "confidence": 0.00-1.00,
  "evidence": [
    {
      "text": "This acquisition is set aside for 8(a) concerns",
      "location": "Page 1, header",
      "relevance": "Explicitly excludes non-8(a) businesses"
    }
  ],
  "rationale": "Clear 8(a) set-aside, SOS cannot compete",
  "categories_checked": ["8a_setaside", "sdvosb", "wosb", "hubzone"],
  "exceptions_considered": ["partial_setaside", "multiple_award"]
}

## Remember
- You ONLY assess set-aside restrictions

### CRITICAL: AMSC Code Overrides
Check Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMSC):
- **AMSC Z, G, A** = GO (even if military platform)
  - Z = Commercial item
  - G = Government has data rights
  - A = Competitive procurement
- **AMSC B, C, D, P** = NO-GO (restricted)

## Analysis Instructions

1. Identify the platform/system first
2. Check for AMSC codes - they override platform restrictions
3. Look for commercial exceptions:
   - "Commercial item"
   - "FAA certified equivalent"
   - "8130-3 acceptable"
4. Consider Navy + FAA 8130 exception for P-8, E-6B, C-40

## Confidence Calibration

### Stage 5: Data Rights - Did they miss:
- Proprietary data restrictions?
- Missing technical data?
- Reverse engineering requirements?

### Stage 6: Vehicles - Did they miss:
- Task order under existing contract?
- Required contract vehicles?
- Closed consortium requirements?

### Stage 7: Scope - Did they miss:
- Multi-site requirements?
- Scope beyond 60-person company?
- CLS/PBL obligations?

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Do the stages conflict with each other?
- Are there Navy + FAA 8130 exceptions that apply?
- Were AMSC code overrides properly considered?
- Any red flags in the accumulated context?

## Decision Framework

If you find a missed knockout:
1. Identify which stage missed it
2. Assess your confidence level
3. Apply appropriate threshold based on knockout type
4. Override only if confidence exceeds threshold

## Output Requirements

{
  "final_decision": "GO|NO-GO",
  "confidence": 0.00-1.00,
  "verification_status": "confirmed|overridden",
  "missed_knockouts": [
    {
      "category": "security_clearance",
      "missed_by_stage": 1,
      "evidence": "Secret clearance required on page 47",
      "override_confidence": 0.99
    }
  ],
  "final_rationale": "All stages correctly identified no knockouts",
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Verify FAA 8130-3 acceptability with CO",
    "Confirm commercial item designation"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Platform identification based on limited information",
    "Possible data rights issues if not truly commercial"
  ]
}

## Remember
- You need VERY high confidence to override 7 previous GO decisions
- Simple knockouts (clearance, set-aside) should NEVER be missed
- Complex business judgments have more leeway
- This is the final decision before commitment
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Pipeline Controller
```python
class MultiStagePipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stages = [
            Stage("security_clearance", batch_prompt_1, agent_prompt_1, threshold=0.99),
            Stage("set_asides", batch_prompt_2, agent_prompt_2, threshold=0.99),
            Stage("platform_technical", batch_prompt_3, agent_prompt_3, threshold=0.95),
            Stage("source_competition", batch_prompt_4, agent_prompt_4, threshold=0.95),
            Stage("technical_data", batch_prompt_5, agent_prompt_5, threshold=0.90),
            Stage("contract_vehicles", batch_prompt_6, agent_prompt_6, threshold=0.90),
            Stage("scope_capability", batch_prompt_7, agent_prompt_7, threshold=0.85),
            Stage("final_verification", None, final_qc_prompt, threshold=0.99)
        ]

    def process_opportunity(self, opportunity, documents):
        context = ContextAccumulator(opportunity)

        for stage in self.stages:
            # Run batch processor
            if stage.batch_prompt:
                batch_result = self.run_batch(stage, documents, context)

                # QC with agent
                agent_result = self.run_agent(stage, documents, context, batch_result)
            else:
                # Final QC only
                agent_result = self.run_agent(stage, documents, context, all_results=context)

            # Check for early termination
            if agent_result['decision'] == 'NO-GO' and agent_result['confidence'] >= stage.threshold:
                return self.route_to_no_go_writer(agent_result, context)

            # Update context
            context.add_stage_result(stage.name, agent_result)

        # All stages passed
        return self.route_to_go_writer(context)
```

### Cost Analysis (500 opportunities/year)

#### Per Opportunity:
- 7 Batch stages × 5K tokens = 35K tokens @ $1/1M = $0.035
- 7 Agent QC × 3K tokens = 21K tokens @ $2/1M = $0.042
- 1 Final QC × 5K tokens = 5K tokens @ $2/1M = $0.010
- **Total: $0.087 per opportunity**

#### Annual:
- 500 opportunities × $0.087 = **$43.50/year**
- With retries and overruns: **< $100/year**

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: >95% agreement with human review
2. **False Negative Rate**: <1% (missed knockouts)
3. **False Positive Rate**: <5% (incorrect knockouts)
4. **Processing Time**: <2 minutes per opportunity
5. **Early Termination Rate**: >60% (cost savings)

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2)
- Implement Stages 1-3 (Security, Set-asides, Platform)
- Test with 20 known opportunities
- Validate early termination logic

### Phase 2 (Week 3-4)
- Add Stages 4-7
- Test complete pipeline
- Tune confidence thresholds

### Phase 3 (Week 5)
- Deploy to production
- Monitor metrics
- Gather feedback

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Stage Failure**: Each stage independently logged, can restart from any point
2. **API Timeouts**: Exponential backoff with maximum 3 retries
3. **Context Loss**: Persistent state between stages
4. **Cost Overrun**: Circuit breaker at 2x expected cost
5. **Accuracy Issues**: Human review queue for low-confidence decisions

## Conclusion

This 8-stage architecture provides:
- **Higher accuracy** through specialized focus
- **Lower cost** through early termination
- **Better debugging** through stage isolation
- **Clear audit trail** through context accumulation

At 500 opportunities/year and <$100 annual cost, we can afford to be thorough while maintaining efficiency.
