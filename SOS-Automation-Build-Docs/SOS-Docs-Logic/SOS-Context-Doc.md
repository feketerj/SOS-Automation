# Suggested Integration for UEI and CAGE Codes

These identifiers are essential for government contracting context, as they enable entity verification in systems like SAM.gov and facilitate proposal submissions, compliance checks, and award tracking. Based on the existing chunk structure, they fit best under an expanded or new chunk focused on government-related details. Here's how to add them seamlessly:

- **Recommended Placement**: Insert into "# Chunk 5: Government Programs and Background" (as it already covers federal contracts and operations). If you prefer a standalone, create "# Chunk 11: Government Registration Identifiers" at the end for modularity.
