### **SOS Comprehensive Opportunity Assessment Checklist**

**Context:** Your role is to evaluate government contract opportunities for Source One Spares (SOS). For each criterion, extract exact text excerpts, including page numbers from the announcement, and cross-reference both SOS's and partners' capability documents to substantiate alignment with requirements.

---

#### **I. Preliminary Gates & Initial Review (Phase 0)**

**Objective:** Ensure the opportunity is relevant and current before deep diving.

1.  **Is this Aviation-Related?**
    *   **Search for:** "Aircraft," "helicopter," "rotorcraft," "airplane," manufacturer names (Boeing, Airbus, Bell, Sikorsky), military designators (C-130, KC-46), components (engine, avionics), support equipment (GSE, AGE), or relevant PSC/NAICS codes (15XX/16XX/17XX, 3364XX).
    *   **Decision:** CONTINUE or **NO-GO** (Not aviation-related).
    *   **Required Output:** Quote exact aviation-related text with page number.

2.  **Is this Opportunity Current?**
    *   **Search for:** "Response due," "Closing date," "Proposal due," "Deadline," "Offers due".
    *   **Decision:** CONTINUE or **NO-GO** (Expired).
    *   **Required Output:** Quote exact due date, state today's date.

---

#### **II. Immediate Disqualifiers (Hard Stop Analysis) (Phase 1)**

**CRITICAL:** These hard stops **OVERRIDE ALL positive indicators**. If any criterion results in a "No-Go," **immediately recommend against pursuing the opportunity**. Use a scoring system of 1 (No-Go), 2 (Unknown), 3 (Go).

1.  **Source Approval Requirement (SAR)**
    *   **Search for:** "source approval required," "approved source list," "qualified suppliers list," "QPL," "QML," "requires engineering source approval," "Government source approval required," "military specification".
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   IF "source approval required" AND military specification → **NO-GO**. SOS **cannot meet Military SARs**.
        *   IF "FAA source approval" → **Go** (SOS can meet).
        *   IF "Found WITH 'submit SAR package' or 'submit Source Approval Request'" → **REQUIRES ANALYSIS**.
        *   IF Not found → **Go**.
    *   **BD Strategy for Military SAR:** If NO-GO due to Military SAR, track as "NO-GO - SAR Present (CO Contact Made)" and contact the Contracting Officer about future refurbished/surplus acceptability.

2.  **Sole Source Justification**
    *   **Search for:** "sole source," "only one responsible source," "single source," "brand name justification," "intent to sole source".
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   IF "Sole source to [specific company]" (not SOS) → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF "intent to sole source" → **REQUIRES ANALYSIS** (can be challenged).
        *   IF "Brand name or equal" AND no SAR → **REQUIRES ANALYSIS** (opportunity exists).
        *   IF "Brand name or equal" AND SAR present → **NO-GO** (SAR wins).
        *   IF Not found → **Go**.
    *   **BD Strategy for Intent to Sole Source:** If REQUIRES ANALYSIS, prompt to contact the Contracting Officer to "plant seeds for future contract modifications or recompetes".

3.  **Technical Data Availability / Restrictions**
    *   **Search for:** "drawings not available," "technical data not available," "data rights," "proprietary data," "government does not have," "contractor will not receive," "no GFI," "OEM owns technical data," "proprietary technical data".
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   IF "drawings not available" OR "technical data not available" → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF "OEM owns technical data" → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF "proprietary technical data" → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF "Limited technical data" or "some drawings" → **REQUIRES ANALYSIS**.
        *   IF "government owns technical data" or "technical data available upon award" → **Go**.
        *   IF repair/overhaul AND "FAA standards apply" → **Go**.
        *   IF Not found → **Go**.

4.  **Security Clearance Requirements**
    *   **Search for:** "security clearance," "secret," "top secret," "classified," "facility clearance," "personnel clearance," "security requirements".
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   IF "Secret clearance required" or similar → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF "May require clearance" → **REQUIRES ANALYSIS**.
        *   IF "unclassified" explicitly stated → **Go**.
        *   IF Not found → **Go**.

5.  **New Parts Only Restriction**
    *   **Search for:** "factory new only," "new manufacture only," "no refurbished," "no rebuilt," "no overhauled," "no used," "new condition only".
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   IF any of above phrases → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF "Prefer new" or "new for critical items" → **REQUIRES ANALYSIS**.
        *   IF "Refurbished acceptable" → **Go** (positive indicator).
        *   IF Not found → **Go**.

6.  **Prohibited Certifications (AS9100, NADCAP)**
    *   **Search for:** "AS9100," "NADCAP".
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   IF "AS9100 required" OR "NADCAP required" → **NO-GO**. (SOS lacks these:).
        *   IF "ISO 9001 required" → **Go** (SOS has this:).
        *   IF "AS9120B required" → **Go** (SOS has this:).
        *   IF "FAA certifications required" → **Go** (SOS has these:).
        *   IF Not found → **Go**.

7. ITAR/Export Control Requirements**
    *   **Search Terms:** "ITAR," "export control," "export license required," "EAR," "international traffic in arms".
    *   **Decision Logic:**
    *   **IF "ITAR registration required"**: **GO**. SOS explicitly "supports ITAR compliance for exports where required", and is "CAPABLE" of ITAR compliance "with planning". Therefore, this requirement aligns with SOS's capabilities,        and the condition "no SOS capability" from the original logic would not be met.
    *   **IF "Export license required"**: **REQUIRES ANALYSIS**. While SOS supports ITAR compliance with planning, obtaining specific export licenses might involve additional steps or timelines that warrant further review.
    *   **IF Not found**: **GO**. If no ITAR or export requirements are found in the solicitation, it does not pose a barrier to SOS.

8.  **Due Date**
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   IF submission due date has passed or is less than two days away → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF proposal preparation timeline is within one week → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF due date is 25 days or more from assessment (**RFP only**) → **Go**.
        *   IF due date is between 10 and 24 days from assessment → **Needs further analysis**.

9.  **Work Complexity**
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   IF complexity is high (e.g., managing various locations or performing tasks outside SOS core competencies) → **NO-GO**.
        *   IF complexity is within SOS core competencies → **Go**.
        *   IF complexity is moderate but closely related to SOS core competencies → **Unknown**.

10. **Eligibility Restrictions**
    *   **Decision Logic:** IF there are eligibility requirements that SOS does not meet → **NO-GO**.
    *   **Note:** SOS qualifies as a small business under most NAICS codes.

11. **Financial/Bonding Requirements**
    *   **Decision Logic:** IF financial or bonding requirements are a barrier for SOS → **NO-GO**.
    *   **Thresholds:** Bonding <$500K is manageable; $500K-$2M requires CFO evaluation; >$2M is a strategic decision. No bonding mentioned is a positive indicator.

12. **Subcontracting Limitations**
    *   **Decision Logic:** IF SOS is either (a) not allowed to act as a subcontractor or (b) not permitted to subcontract part of the work itself, if needed → **NO-GO**.
