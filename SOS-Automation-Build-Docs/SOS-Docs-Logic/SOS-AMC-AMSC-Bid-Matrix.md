#### Reference Explanation 					

Code	Description (Plain English)	SAR Required?	Gov’t Tech-Data Package (TDP)	Can SOS Bid?*	Notes / Work-arounds

AMC 1	Fully competitive – data is in-hand and proven; item has already competed at least once.	No	Yes	Yes	Standard FAR/DFARS competition; SOS just needs traceable parts.

AMC 2	Competitive for the first buy once data released.	No	Yes (or released with RFP)	Yes	Good entry point; expect tight schedule control.

AMC 3	Limited data – must buy from OEM unless an alternate wins Source Approval.	Yes	Partial or none	Not until SAR approved	Typical path: submit SAR + test-article.

AMC 4	Sole-source (unique design / IP).	Yes (hard)	No	No (unless teaming with OEM)	Practical only via licensing or teaming.

AMC 5	Prime-contractor only (no usable data despite sub-tier info).	Yes (nearly impossible)	No	No	Essentially locked unless OEM changes stance.

AMSC A	Gov’t unsure of data rights (under review).	Maybe	Questionable	Possibly (case-by-case)	Treat as AMC-3 until rights cleared.

AMSC B	Item on Source-Control drawing – OEM list governs.	Yes	Usually yes (but controlled)	Only if OEM lists SOS	Register as authorized distributor.

AMSC C	Engineering source approval required for quality reasons.	Yes	Limited	No (until SAR)	Common on safety-critical parts.

AMSC D	Data physically unavailable.	Yes	No	No	Only path: develop reverse-engineering SAR.

AMSC G	Gov’t owns complete data with unlimited rights.	No	Yes (full)	Yes	Ideal for small-biz entry.

AMSC H	Gov’t lacks legible/complete data.	Yes	Poor	Unlikely	Wait for re-engineering effort by DoD.

AMSC P	Gov’t doesn’t own data rights & cannot buy them.	Yes	No	No	Only via teaming/license.

AMSC R	Gov’t doesn’t own data; uneconomical to buy.	Yes	No	No (unless OEM deal)	Similar to P but driven by cost.

AMSC T	Item controlled by a QPL/QML.	No (if QPL source)	Yes	Only if on QPL	Become an approved QPL distributor.

AMSC Z	Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS).	No	Commercial data	Yes	Competes like any commercial part.

1G	AMC 1 + AMSC G → fully open competition with complete data.	No	Yes	Yes	Bread-and-butter competitive buys.

1R	AMC 1 + AMSC R → competition allowed but bidders must secure OEM data/license.	Maybe	No	Yes if SOS can supply OEM-traceable parts.	Cite OEM license or resale agreement in quote.

2G	AMC 2 + AMSC G → first-time competition, full data.	No	Yes	Yes	Watch for learning-curve pricing risk.

3B	AMC 3 + AMSC B → OEM or listed sources only.	Yes	Controlled	Only via OEM listing	Push OEM distribution agreement.

3P	AMC 3 + AMSC P → OEM only; data locked.	Yes	No	No	Teamed bids only.

#### Quick Rules of Thumb			

1. If the letter is G or Z: bid freely; data is open or item is COTS.			

2. If the number is 1 or 2 but the letter isn’t G/Z: you can still bid, but check whether data rights or QPL status impose extra hoops.			

3. Any ‘3/4/5’ number or ‘P/R/D’ letter: assume SAR or teaming with the OEM is mandatory.			

4. Source Approval Route: Typical timeline is 6-18 months, requires sample part, eng/test data, and past-performance package. Low-ROI for one-off buys unless volume justifies.
