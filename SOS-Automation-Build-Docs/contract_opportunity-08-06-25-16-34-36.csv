Statement of Work Summary

The Contractor shall provide services for the United States Mission, Bogota, Colombia as described. This consists of freight forwarder services for the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Section (INL), U.S. Embassy Bogota, Colombia to receive various shipments to and from Colombia and to perform import/export and shipping requirements in support of INL programs. The shipments will include but are not limited to; aircraft parts and components, hazardous materials, ammunition, vehicles, and vehicle parts, building and facilities equipment, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cargo, and general commodities. The primary responsibility is to provide proper, timely and cost effective freight forwarding services for the following INL programs: ARAVI (Colombian National Police Air Service), CNP Interdiction (Base security, ABD, Junglas, Diran, etc.), Integrated Eradication, Rural Security (Carabineros), CD Brigade, International Cooperation Division (ICD), Rule of Law (Justice, Human Rights, and Corrections), Program Development &amp;Support (PD&amp;S), Department of Justice (DOJ), Coast Guard / Colombian NAVY, Corrections, and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). This list is considered representative and shall not be considered as all inclusive.

The Contractor shall furnish all managerial, administrative, direct labor personnel, materials and transportation that are necessary to accomplish all work as required by this contract. Contractor employees shall be on site only for performance of contractual duties and not for other business purposes.

In terms of geographical location, eligible companies shall have warehouse facilities to receive/store cargo in the area surrounding the Miami (FL) airport due to the following:


	The geographical distance between Colombia and Miami is a key factor for the INL Colombia operations, making the shipment expenses lower than shipping from other locations in the US. 
	Availability of several options in terms of US flag carriers for air and maritime shipments capable of moving cargo to Latin America. 
	Miami has availability of daily air and weekly maritime shipment options to move the cargo from or into the US. 
	The Miami seaport is the biggest getaway to move cargo from the US to Latin America, which makes it a strategic origin point for maritime shipments considering that the majority of the INL cargo will arrive to the Cartagena or Santa Marta seaports, both located on the Colombian Caribbean coast. 


The contractor shall establish effective service controls for the prompt and complete performance under this contract. This shall include:


	Adequate terminal facilities to effectively receive and store shipments.
	Adequate facilities to effectively service the receipt of shipments.
	Equipment deemed necessary to perform services including temperature protection for commodities requiring temperature control.
	Prompt inspection and notification of damaged cargo.
	Protection from the elements and securing of received material.
	Transportation and documentation of hazardous materials.
	Packing, freight handling, forwarding, cargo storage, customs clearance and other related services that apply to shipments originating from, consigned to, routed through, and/or moved from the United States to Colombia, from Colombia to points in the United States of Government-owned materials.


The measure of performance shall be the condition of packed articles upon arrival at their destination, accuracy of documents, and shipping according to priority status. The Contractor must appreciate the importance of U.S. Government property and always take the greatest care in handling and packing such articles. No claim for any additional compensation shall be considered unless it has been authorized by the Government in writing in advance. The Government shall not be responsible for any work performed that is not specifically provided for under the terms of this contract or authorized by the Government in writing in advance.

Packing Specifications and Responsibilities

Labor employed to perform services under this contract shall be experienced and competent in the performance of such services.


	The Contractor agrees to provide complete services for surveying, packing, crating, weighing, and marking of official Government shipments of commodities including, but not limited to, aircraft parts and components, hazardous materials, ammunition, vehicles and vehicle parts, building and facilities equipment, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cargo, and general commodities, for shipment within and from the United States of America. Such services will be performed on goods located primarily within the United States of America (export), as requested.
	The Contractor shall provide all necessary packing and crating material required by this specification and standard industry practice for the services under this contract.
	The Contractor shall provide export packing and related services following the best commercial practices to ensure a shipment of the least tare weight and smallest cubic measurement that is compatible with assurance of transportation to destinations without damage or pilferage to containers or contents. Export packing shall include, but shall not be limited to, padding, dunnage and packing into cases, barrels, or crates of all fragile items.
	Although some shipments will be of a high priority nature and will require immediate shipment, it is most practical to consolidate the packing and shipping of items. Consolidations will not contain mixed priorities. Where there is a conflict between order priorities on the purchase order and operational requirements, INL will direct the priority of shipment.




Freight Handling

The Contractor shall act on behalf of the Government on any selected incoming and outgoing Government cargo that may be assigned to the Contractor under this contract, including the effecting of necessary transport of Government cargo from the United States of America to Colombia and vice versa. The Contractor accepts full responsibility for any and all losses and/or damage, from the time such cargo is received into the hands of the Contractor until it is released into the custody of the Government as evidenced by a signed receipt. The Contractor further agrees that in any instance involving loss or damage to the Government cargo, where the Contractor fails to exercise reasonable diligence, the Contractor shall assume full responsibility for such losses or damage including payment of claims for such losses or damage.



The Contractor shall transport all incoming Government cargo handled under the contract from the contractor&rsquo;s warehouse in the Miami (FL) area to the final destination in the Bogota area or elsewhere in Colombia, according to the order priority on the purchase order. Purchase orders for other commodities shall be marked as urgent if they require expedited shipping. Otherwise, contractor can assume the shipment is regular and should be consolidated.



Freight Forwarding and Warehousing Services



The contractor shall provide freight forwarding and warehousing services including but not limited to:




	Coordinate receipt and delivery of freight, from the individual commodity supplier&rsquo;s origin points to the contractor&rsquo;s warehouse.
	Verify, count, weight, cube and condition of all received commodities at the time of receipt and in the event of loss, damage, or shortage promptly notify INL and assist with sufficient documentation to justify a INL claim for compensation.
	Provide warehousing and storage services for commodities during the period of consolidation and while awaiting ocean/air shipment.
	Consolidate freight and stuff export containers.
	Secure air freight from an American Flag Air Carrier utilizing the most economical rate available. All Ocean freight must be pre-approved by INL in advance of booking.
	The contractor shall utilize air freight when air freight is most economical. Ocean freight shall be utilized for oversized or extremely heavy shipments. Ocean freight will not be used often due to the limited transportation capacity within Colombia and the safety and travel requirements to clear freight at Port.  The contractor shall confirm with INL Bogota the method of shipment if doubt exists as to whether it will be air freight or ocean freight.
	For import shipments the contractor shall make the necessary arrangements for clearing the freight through U.S. Customs and shipping the freight to a supplier as designated by INL Bogota.




Shipping (and/or Packing) of cargo intended for the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement transportation is a highly specialized function. The measure of performance shall be the condition of packed articles upon arrival at their destination, accuracy of documents, and shipping according to priority status.

Statement of Work Summary

The Contractor shall provide services for the United States Mission, Bogota, Colombia as described. This consists of freight forwarder services for the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Section (INL), U.S. Embassy Bogota, Colombia to receive various shipments to and from Colombia and to perform import/export and shipping requirements in support of INL programs. The shipments will include but are not limited to; aircraft parts and components, hazardous materials, ammunition, vehicles, and vehicle parts, building and facilities equipment, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cargo, and general commodities. The primary responsibility is to provide proper, timely and cost effective freight forwarding services for the following INL programs: ARAVI (Colombian National Police Air Service), CNP Interdiction (Base security, ABD, Junglas, Diran, etc.), Integrated Eradication, Rural Security (Carabineros), CD Brigade, International Cooperation Division (ICD), Rule of Law (Justice, Human Rights, and Corrections), Program Development &amp;Support (PD&amp;S), Department of Justice (DOJ), Coast Guard / Colombian NAVY, Corrections, and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). This list is considered representative and shall not be considered as all inclusive.

The Contractor shall furnish all managerial, administrative, direct labor personnel, materials and transportation that are necessary to accomplish all work as required by this contract. Contractor employees shall be on site only for performance of contractual duties and not for other business purposes.

In terms of geographical location, eligible companies shall have warehouse facilities to receive/store cargo in the area surrounding the Miami (FL) airport due to the following:


	The geographical distance between Colombia and Miami is a key factor for the INL Colombia operations, making the shipment expenses lower than shipping from other locations in the US. 
	Availability of several options in terms of US flag carriers for air and maritime shipments capable of moving cargo to Latin America. 
	Miami has availability of daily air and weekly maritime shipment options to move the cargo from or into the US. 
	The Miami seaport is the biggest getaway to move cargo from the US to Latin America, which makes it a strategic origin point for maritime shipments considering that the majority of the INL cargo will arrive to the Cartagena or Santa Marta seaports, both located on the Colombian Caribbean coast. 


The contractor shall establish effective service controls for the prompt and complete performance under this contract. This shall include:


	Adequate terminal facilities to effectively receive and store shipments.
	Adequate facilities to effectively service the receipt of shipments.
	Equipment deemed necessary to perform services including temperature protection for commodities requiring temperature control.
	Prompt inspection and notification of damaged cargo.
	Protection from the elements and securing of received material.
	Transportation and documentation of hazardous materials.
	Packing, freight handling, forwarding, cargo storage, customs clearance and other related services that apply to shipments originating from, consigned to, routed through, and/or moved from the United States to Colombia, from Colombia to points in the United States of Government-owned materials.


The measure of performance shall be the condition of packed articles upon arrival at their destination, accuracy of documents, and shipping according to priority status. The Contractor must appreciate the importance of U.S. Government property and always take the greatest care in handling and packing such articles. No claim for any additional compensation shall be considered unless it has been authorized by the Government in writing in advance. The Government shall not be responsible for any work performed that is not specifically provided for under the terms of this contract or authorized by the Government in writing in advance.

Packing Specifications and Responsibilities

Labor employed to perform services under this contract shall be experienced and competent in the performance of such services.


	The Contractor agrees to provide complete services for surveying, packing, crating, weighing, and marking of official Government shipments of commodities including, but not limited to, aircraft parts and components, hazardous materials, ammunition, vehicles and vehicle parts, building and facilities equipment, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cargo, and general commodities, for shipment within and from the United States of America. Such services will be performed on goods located primarily within the United States of America (export), as requested.
	The Contractor shall provide all necessary packing and crating material required by this specification and standard industry practice for the services under this contract.
	The Contractor shall provide export packing and related services following the best commercial practices to ensure a shipment of the least tare weight and smallest cubic measurement that is compatible with assurance of transportation to destinations without damage or pilferage to containers or contents. Export packing shall include, but shall not be limited to, padding, dunnage and packing into cases, barrels, or crates of all fragile items.
	Although some shipments will be of a high priority nature and will require immediate shipment, it is most practical to consolidate the packing and shipping of items. Consolidations will not contain mixed priorities. Where there is a conflict between order priorities on the purchase order and operational requirements, INL will direct the priority of shipment.


Freight Handling

The Contractor shall act on behalf of the Government on any selected incoming and outgoing Government cargo that may be assigned to the Contractor under this contract, including the effecting of necessary transport of Government cargo from the United States of America to Colombia and vice versa. The Contractor accepts full responsibility for any and all losses and/or damage, from the time such cargo is received into the hands of the Contractor until it is released into the custody of the Government as evidenced by a signed receipt. The Contractor further agrees that in any instance involving loss or damage to the Government cargo, where the Contractor fails to exercise reasonable diligence, the Contractor shall assume full responsibility for such losses or damage including payment of claims for such losses or damage.

The Contractor shall transport all incoming Government cargo handled under the contract from the contractor&rsquo;s warehouse in the Miami (FL) area to the final destination in the Bogota area or elsewhere in Colombia, according to the order priority on the purchase order. Purchase orders for other commodities shall be marked as urgent if they require expedited shipping. Otherwise, contractor can assume the shipment is regular and should be consolidated.

Freight Forwarding and Warehousing Services

The contractor shall provide freight forwarding and warehousing services including but not limited to:


	Coordinate receipt and delivery of freight, from the individual commodity supplier&rsquo;s origin points to the contractor&rsquo;s warehouse.
	Verify, count, weight, cube and condition of all received commodities at the time of receipt and in the event of loss, damage, or shortage promptly notify INL and assist with sufficient documentation to justify a INL claim for compensation.
	Provide warehousing and storage services for commodities during the period of consolidation and while awaiting ocean/air shipment.
	Consolidate freight and stuff export containers.
	Secure air freight from an American Flag Air Carrier utilizing the most economical rate available. All Ocean freight must be pre-approved by INL in advance of booking.
	The contractor shall utilize air freight when air freight is most economical. Ocean freight shall be utilized for oversized or extremely heavy shipments. Ocean freight will not be used often due to the limited transportation capacity within Colombia and the safety and travel requirements to clear freight at Port.  The contractor shall confirm with INL Bogota the method of shipment if doubt exists as to whether it will be air freight or ocean freight.
	For import shipments the contractor shall make the necessary arrangements for clearing the freight through U.S. Customs and shipping the freight to a supplier as designated by INL Bogota.

Q1. Are any of the items to be transported covered under the ITAR?

Q4. Is there a level of effort &ndash; historical data for the number of shipments and type of cargo (classified and unclassified), locations, etc&hellip; for the past 2-3 tears?

HTC711-15-ZR05,DoD Freight Transportation Services,"REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION COMMAND (USTRANSCOM)
DoD Freight Transportation Services
HTC711-15-ZR05
1.  Purpose
This RFI is being issued for informational and planning purposes.  Information gathered under this RFI will be used as market research.  This means that information provided will be used exclusively within USTRANSCOM to facilitate decision making and will only be disclosed to the stakeholders of the requirement.
This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of any kind.  USTRANSCOM is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals for this requirement.  This notice should not be construed as a commitment of any type by the Government to take or not take any action.  Please note USTRANSCOM will not be responsible for any costs incurred by any entity which provides and/or attempts to provide information in response to this RFI.
2.  Background
USTRANSCOM is the Distribution Process Owner (DPO) for the Department of Defense and is the single entity to direct and supervise execution of the strategic distribution system.  The mission of USTRANSCOM is to provide full-spectrum global mobility solutions and related enabling capabilities for supported customers' requirements in peace and war.  USTRANSCOM has a responsibility to improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of distribution related activities within the Department of Defense.  USTRANSCOM is the contracting activity for surface transportation requirements.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is anticipated to be NAICS 488510, Freight Transportation Arrangement.  The acquisition strategy of this requirement has yet to be determined.
3.  Scope
This requirement is in support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).  The anticipated contract will provide Department of Defense Freight Transportation Services (DFTS).  Services encompass support from receipt of the shipment request through final payment for services rendered.  Support will include management of shipments to ensure required transportation is completed successfully, in a satisfactory manner.  Transportation support is required for all DLA Freight All Kinds (FAK) shipments including, but not limited to, First and Second Destination, Scheduled Routes, DLA Disposition Services (formerly known as DRMS), Unit Moves, FEMA support, Humanitarian/Contingency support, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and surge shipments.  Services will be provided between DLA and DCMA locations and other Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD locations within the Continental United States (CONUS) via various equipment types.  Routes may include multiple stops and split pickups.  Shipper locations may be revised, increased, or decreased dependent on DoD structural changes, alignments, operational tempo, and business process changes.  First Destination shipments currently moved under other contracts may be moved in accordance with this Performance Work State (PWS) as those contracts end.  Sites in Alaska and Canada may also be added as necessary.  Only single brokering is permitted for Less than Truckload (LTL), Truck Load (TL), and Scheduled trucks (no brokering restriction on air or rail shipments).
3.  Description
The Government desires fully burdened transportation rates that incorporate all tasks in the PWS, excluding International Customs Brokerage and system accreditation.  As such, USTRANSCOM is seeking industry perspective regarding the pricing structure for this acquisition.
A.  Company Information:  Name, CAGE Code, business size, company's website, any specific background/knowledge relative to this requirement.
B.  Industry Input:  Please review draft solicitation language below regarding Implementation and Joint Test Plans.
     		1.  Implementation Schedule.  The Offeror shall submit their proposed implementation schedule.   The Offeror shall identify a proposed timeline for implementing each location identified in the Shipping Site Implementation List identified in the PWS.  The Shipping Site Implementation List provides the order in which the Government desires implementation; however, the Offeror may propose a different order for the Government to consider when a different order could provide a benefit to the Government, i.e., reduced costs, quicker implementations, etc., so long as all sites are implemented (fully operational, to include establishment of successful information systems connections to the required systems) no later than 28 February 2017.
     		2.  Implementation Approach.  The Offeror shall submit their approach to implementing new services/operations with minimal disruption to existing operations at each location.  This shall include:
      &bull;	Establishment of successful information systems connections
      &bull;	Training of Government personnel in the use of the offeror's Traffic Management System, including track and trace process, report generation, etc.
      &bull;	Equipment availability, to include specialized equipment
      &bull;	Carrier familiarization with each shipping site's unique requirements
          o	For DLA Installations, address Offeror's approach to ensure carriers are familiar with location characteristics (dock locations, installation access, equipment pools, etc.)
          o	For Vendor Shipment Module (VSM) vendor locations, address Offeror's approach to ensure carriers are familiar with hours of operation and access for each pick-up location.
          o	For DLA Disposition, address Offeror's approach to ensure carriers are familiar with hours of operation and access for each pick-up location, including appointment schedule.
      &bull;	24-Hour support notification of a FEMA requirement
3.  Joint Test Plan.  The Offeror shall submit a joint test plan to fully implement and operationally test/validate IT interoperability and integration.  The proposed plan shall include a description of the Offeror's operational testing procedures and approaches to successfully accomplish system deployment and establishment of new system interfaces.
4.  White Papers
Interested parties are requested to submit responses to the following questions.  Responses should be concise (no more than 3 pages) and address only the information requested below.  Again, this information will support market research activities within USTRANSCOM for the DFTS acquisition.    The Government envisions establishing a fixed-price CLIN for system accreditation, to be billed/paid upon the first shipper site going live with all other associated implementation service charges to be included in the fixed-price transportation rate.  Alternatively, the Government is considering including a fixed-price CLIN for all implementation services, per site, to be billed/paid upon successful implementation at each site.
Question 1. Based on the PWS requirements for system accreditation, how would you propose pricing this service?
Question 2. Are prices for implementation services normally included in the fully burdened fixed price transportation rate?  If not, how would you price those services separately?
Question 3. Do you have any other recommendations regarding the pricing structure for system accreditation and implementation services?
Please provide a Rough Order Magnitude Estimate for both system accreditation and a per site implementation service price.
5.  Response Instructions
Responses to this RFI must be submitted to the POCs listed below via e-mail no later than 3:00p.m. Central Time, 4 February 2015.

HTC711-06-R-0001-Synopsis,V -- Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI),"The purpose of this synopsis is to notify interested parties of the upcoming Request for Proposal release for the Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI).  USTRANSCOM intends to issue an unrestricted solicitation, resulting in an indefinite delivery, requirements-type contract.  Period of performance for this contract will include a 3-year base period with two 1-year option periods, and the potential for the contractor to earn two additional 1-year award-term option periods, for a potential 7-year contract.  Solicitation release is scheduled on or about 21 Jun 06, and solicitation closing date is scheduled on or about 11 Aug 06.  Past and present performance information will be required to be submitted approximately 30 days after solicitation release.  This solicitation will be processed as a best-value source selection IAW DFARS 15.3 and USTRANSCOM/TCAQ Operating Instruction 05-11, TCAQ Source Selection Instructions.
DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations/load optimization and mode conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator that will employ best commercial practices. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DOD shippers.  An implementation approach is envisioned with multiple phases based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase I will begin with 18 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CONUS Defense Distribution Centers.  Phase II will include co-located service shippers to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements.  Phase III will include additional service shippers throughout CONUS. The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfil those requirements. 

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 488510 – Freight Transportation Arrangement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

HTC711-05-0001,V -- Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI) Face-to-Face RFI,"1.  DESCRIPTION.
This is a Request for Information (RFI).  This synopsis offers an additional opportunity for industry to elaborate on/clarify responses to the RFI and present ideas and comments on the DTCI project in regard to commercial best practices and commercial transportation management capabilities.  The following description and background information was previously posted in our RFI dated 23 Mar 05.

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is responsible for providing for the transportation needs of the Department of Defense. On 16 Sep 03, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) designated the Commander, USTRANSCOM as Distribution Process Owner (DPO).  Among the DPO's key responsibilities are to:

•	Improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of distribution-related activities—deployment, sustainment, and deployment support during peace and war.
•	Serve as the single entity to direct and supervise execution of the Strategic Distribution system.

The DPO's span of influence, as depicted on the following page, is from the factory, beginning with acquisition of needed supplies and materials, to the foxhole, from storage, to transport inter-theatre to transport intra-theatre, and to tactical movement and distribution.   

 

DoD service agencies’ current business processes and segregated transportation management arrangements need to be transformed to reach the desired end state of total asset management and in-transit visibility.  The Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI) is one project moving DoD closer to achieving this goal, focusing on the movement of requisitioned supplies/materials within the Continental United States (CONUS). 

	a.  DTCI Vision Statement:  Improve the reliability, predictability, and efficiency of DoD materiel moving within the Continental United States through a long-term partnership with a world-class coordinator of transportation management services. 

	b.  Goals:

&#61553;	Improve operational effectiveness
&#61553;	Improve visibility, reliability, & predictability
&#61553;	Improve customer confidence 
&#61553;	Reduce cycle times
&#61553;	Increase efficiencies
&#61553;	Use commercial best practices 
&#61553;	Ensure strong small business participation
&#61553;	Performance improvement enabled by metrics 
&#61553;	Reduce overall cost to the government

	c.  Value Proposition:  Improve performance of distribution to CONUS-  
based operational forces and depots--with corollary dollar savings.
     
	d.  Strategy:  Gain management oversight of enterprise-wide transportation requirements and track performance trends and details.  DTCI will:

•	Provide greater opportunities to generate full truck loads and modal shifts
•	Provide opportunities to achieve efficiency through pooling and enroute consolidation
•	Allow DoD management to re-focus more on bottom-line performance and results
•	Provide needed visibility into system-wide transportation movements
•	Support the capture of more effective, complete, and timely performance metrics
•	Provide performance metrics against desired goals
•	Allow for improved management of resources 
•	Allow DoD management and resources to become focused on achieving further gains in distribution efficiency and effectiveness in the future
•	Manage and coordinate previously decentralized DoD domestic freight movement 

The DoD is committed to continual service improvements that will result in improved support of operational forces based in the US as well as DoD repair depots. Improving visibility of all traffic movement patterns and performance across the supply chain is the key to the creation of an adaptive supply chain.  In addition to operational benefits, the corollary dollar savings that will accrue to the DoD Components from DTCI will be available for other critical needs.

2.  BACKGROUND.

Today, DoD shippers in the CONUS initiate freight movements using commercial freight transportation providers to myriad U.S. destinations, creating thousands of origin-destination pairs.  Multiple information systems are employed to execute and manage shipment activity.  There is no centralized planning, coordination, or control.  Individual DoD shippers act unilaterally by independently selecting transportation mode, level of service, and transportation provider.  There is limited collaborative visibility or coordination of movement requirements and therefore there are limited opportunities to leverage the entire DoD workload to create the volume needed to drive increased velocity and reduced cost.  Such leverage is a well recognized “best practice” in high performing private sector distribution systems.

 

	a.  Scope of DTCI:    DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations / load optimization and modal conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator/coordinator(s) that will employ best commercial practices to achieve the goals stated above. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DoD shippers.  A multiple phased implementation approach is envisioned based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase 1 will begin with the 19 Defense Logistics Agency CONUS distribution centers.  Based on the results of the DLA experience, the next phase may include the current Tailored Transportation Contract participants and other co-located DoD shippers within a specified radius to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements.  The final phase would include remaining DoD shippers throughout the CONUS. 

The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfill those requirements.

            b.  Requirements:   The DTCI coordinator(s) will provide transportation management services to arrange, coordinate, monitor, and control outbound freight shipments from receipt of shipment request information through final delivery; process timely payment to subcontractors and carriers for services provided; accept, process, and settle claims resulting from loss or damage; manage carrier quality and performance; and assist in the identification and delivery of astray freight; provide In-Transit Visibility (ITV) information to the government’s Global Transportation Network (GTN) within 4 hours of freight pick-up, delivery, and exception notices (any time a planned delivery will not be delivered as required by the shipper).  The contractor must have a near-real-time shipment tracking system and provide full access to the shipper and other government employees specifically designated by the contracting officer.  The contractor must initiate process improvement (continuous network improvements including shipment optimization, consolidation, routing improvements and other value-added services), and the contractor must provide the contract officer or his or her designee with customized management information reports related to shipment volume, costs, and other criteria that characterize and provide performance-related views of the transactions included in this contract.  The potential number of shipments that may be included in this initiative could exceed 2 million shipments a year with a combined freight weight of over 1 billion pounds per year.  The contractor must have the capability to meet surges for wartime and other contingencies.  This contract will have a phased approach predicated by location, commodities, and possibly functionality. 

          c.  Exclusions:  In the initial phase, the government will exclude arms, ammunition, explosives or fireworks; missiles or rockets; narcotics and dangerous drugs; etiologic agents; government firearms and weapons; live animals; bulk commodities; human remains; coins; currency; precious metals; refrigerated cargo; food, fresh, frozen, or requiring refrigeration; postage stamps or stamped envelopes; express small packages less than 150 pounds; postal shipments; unit moves destined for locations outside of the CONUS (by exception); sensitive and classified shipments or any items requiring transportation security service (Constant Surveillance Service is not excluded), the CONUS segment of transportation services provided under the SDDC Universal Services ocean carrier contracts; household goods, privately owned vehicles,  hazardous waste.  During the period of performance of the contract, and based on competitive pricing analysis, government may add some or all of the initially excluded workload to this contract.

	d.  Phased Approach (Draft):  The initial phase of DTCI is a partnership between the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The first phase will service 19 DLA depots: 

 

Subsequent phasing will incorporate additional shipping locations to be served, i.e. locations within a 50-mile radius of the DLA depots (to include current TTC sites), service installations, and other DOD shipping activities.  In final phases, the Military Services and other Defense Agencies will be encompassed into a total DoD partnership.  A jointly staffed Project Management Office (PMO) has been established at USTRANSCOM to develop requirements, execute the acquisition, and provide implementation guidance over the life of the project.

		3)  Phase 3:  Additional Service locations and agencies such as DCMA (selected activities to be identified in the RFP).

	e.  Industry Interaction:  To build upon DoD’s strong partnership with industry and to ensure a smooth and effective transition to the DTCI, many communication channels have been established to facilitate this exchange:

•	Industry Day meetings, to provide and update information to potential bidders
•	Presentations and participation at Industry Association and other government conferences and meetings
•	DTCI website, www.doddtci.org 
•	Briefings and communication vehicles for multiple non-industry audiences (i.e., Congressional DoD oversight committee staffs, Small Business Administration, and  internal DoD customers)

	f.  Key Milestones (Projected):

Third Quarter FY 2005	Draft solicitation for industry comments

Fourth Quarter FY 2005	Pre-solicitation conference

First Quarter FY 2006		Final solicitation

Second Quarter FY 2006	Receive Proposals

Third Quarter FY 2006	Award/Begin Ramp-Up

Second Quarter FY 2007	Begin Phased-In Performance

           g.  Actions:  Draft requirements documents will be released to industry and the services for comment with notices published on FedBizOpps and on the DTCI website: www.doddtci.org.  The draft solicitation in its entirety will be posted for industry review prior to conducting a pre-solicitation conference and site visit at the DDSP Depot.  During this conference, a detailed briefing of the requirements will be presented, a site visit for offerors to facilitate an understanding of one of the most demanding and highly automated depot pick, pack and pull, operations, current transportation operations.  Also, a similar site visit will be arranged for a different date for offerors to observe operations of a less demanding and less automated depot for the purpose of providing prospective offerors with an opportunity to understand the diversity and volume of workload between the DoD highest volume depots and the lowest depots in the DLS system.  Instructions for proposal preparation will be discussed in conjunction with the source selection evaluation criteria leading to a best value contract award decision.  Specific instructions and information regarding the pre-solicitation conference will be provided as soon as the details are finalized.  Upon issuance of a final solicitation, a pre-proposal conference is anticipated as well.
