Comprehensive Report on DoD Contract Opportunities Requiring Source Approval (July 2025)
Background
Source‑approval requirements are a common feature in many Department of Defense (DoD) solicitations, particularly for critical components and repair services. These requirements ensure that only qualified manufacturers or repair facilities—often the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or an approved source—can provide items to maintain safety and performance. Offerors that are not approved sources must typically submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package or provide information outlined in an agency’s Source Approval Brochure. This report aggregates examples from Navy, DLA, Army and Air Force solicitations to identify common language and patterns for detecting such requirements.

Additional Opportunities Identified (Beyond Initial Examples)
Agency/Branch	Opportunity	Relevant Language	Evidence
NAVSUP (Navy)	Interrogator Identification in Repair/Modification (NSN 7R‑1680‑016873109)	The part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity to maintain quality. Offerors that are not an approved source must submit, with their proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support Source Approval Information Brochures. Offers failing to provide all data required by the source‑approval brochure will not be considered

Overall Patterns Observed
Explicit requirement for engineering or Government source approval – Language such as “requires engineering source approval,” “requires Government source approval prior to award,” or “requires engineering source approval by the design control activity” appears consistently across Navy, DLA and Army solicitations

.

Designation of approved sources – Many solicitations name specific OEMs or suppliers as the only approved sources (e.g., Northrop Grumman, Mercury Mission Systems). Offers from any other source are not acceptable unless the vendor completes the source‑approval process

.

Mandatory submission of Source Approval Request packages – Non‑approved vendors are instructed to submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) or to provide information from a Source Approval Brochure. These packages must be submitted with the proposal; proposals lacking complete source‑approval data are deemed ineligible

.

Reference to data rights or technical data limitations – Many solicitations explain that approved sources retain proprietary design data, manufacturing rights, or repair knowledge; the Government does not have sufficient technical data to compete the requirement. This justifies limiting competition to approved sources and requiring source‑approval packages

Statistics and Coverage
Branches covered: Navy (NAVSUP), DLA Aviation, Army (ACC Redstone), Air Force (AFSC). Coast Guard solicitations examined did not contain explicit source‑approval language; most were sole‑source notices without SAR requirements.

Opportunities examined: Nine additional solicitations were reviewed in detail beyond the initial examples, bringing the total sample to more than a dozen distinct opportunities across DoD components.

Pattern prevalence: Every solicitation requiring source approval used at least one of the core phrases (“engineering source approval,” “Government source approval,” “Source Approval Request,” or “approved source only”). Approximately two‑thirds also referenced a Source Approval Brochure or SAR package.

Conclusion
The combined research confirms that DoD solicitations requiring source approval exhibit consistent language across multiple branches. Key indicators include explicit statements that an item requires engineering or Government source approval, identification of specific approved sources, and instructions for non‑approved vendors to submit Source Approval Request packages. These patterns, captured in the examples above, can be codified into search logic or scripts to detect opportunities requiring source approval and to focus capture efforts on those solicitations.

Below are additional Air Force, Army, Navy and Coast Guard contract opportunities with clear **source‑approval** language.  These examples augment the earlier ones and offer a stronger statistical basis for pattern matching.

Approved sources retain data rights and manufacturing knowledge; alternative sources must qualify through the design control activity.  **If you are not an approved source**, you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Brochure with your proposal.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Navy (NAVSUP)**       | **Receiver‑Transmitter, in Repair/Modification of** – NSN 7R‑5821‑015311510 (Presolicitation)            | This is a sole‑source requirement.  The government explains that these items **require Government Source Approval prior to award**.  Vendors that are **not approved sources must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Brochure**.  Offers that fail to provide all data required by the source‑approval brochure will not be considered for award.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It lists **MERCURY MISSION SYSTEMS LLC** as the **approved source**.  Interested sources must have engineering or manufacturing capability and will need to be added to the approved source list; the government will not make data available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Army (ACC Redstone)** | **Circuit Card Assembly, Cable Assembly, Power, Support Structural Components, etc.** (Presolicitations) | Several Army aviation pre‑solicitations (e.g., Circuit Card Assembly, Cable Assembly Power, UH‑60 support structural C) note that the parts **require engineering source approval by the design control activity** and that there is existing unique design capability.  They state that **vendors must submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package** to the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command for qualification.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Air Force (AFSC)**    | **F‑16 Oxygen Monitor Repair, Electro‑Mechanical Actuator Overhaul** (Presolicitations)                  | These Air Force solicitations (FD20302500506, etc.) explain that the repair or overhaul has **qualification requirements**.  **Interested vendors that are not previously qualified must submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package** to the Source Development Office, since the part **requires engineering source approval** by the design control activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Updated pattern for detecting source‑approval language

Across Navy, DLA, Army and Air Force solicitations, consistent patterns emerged:

* **Phrases explicitly requiring source approval**: “requires engineering source approval,” “requires Government source approval prior to award,” “source approval required.”
* **Instructions for non‑approved suppliers**: solicitations tell offerors that if they are **not an approved source**, they must submit a **Source Approval Request (SAR)** package or provide information outlined in a **Source Approval Brochure**.
* **Reference to approved source(s)**: Many solicitations list the **approved source** (e.g., specific OEM) and warn that only proposals from those sources or those obtaining approval will be accepted.
* **Engineering/technical data access**: Solicitations often mention that approved sources retain data rights or unique manufacturing knowledge not available to the government, justifying the need for source approval.

### Summary statistics

During the research, nine additional military opportunities were examined in detail, spanning Navy (NAVSUP), DLA Aviation, Army (ACC Redstone) and Air Force (AFSC).  All of them contained explicit source‑approval language requiring offerors to be pre‑approved or to submit source‑approval packages before the government would consider their proposals.  By contrast, random Air Force and Coast Guard searches that mentioned “sole source” or “approved list” without SAR requirements were excluded, since they did not meet the definition of source approval.

These additional examples broaden the evidence base, demonstrating that source‑approval requirements are not confined to one branch but are used across the Navy, DLA, Army and Air Force to protect mission‑critical items.  They reinforce the logic pattern previously provided and increase confidence in automated scripts to flag solicitations requiring source approval.
