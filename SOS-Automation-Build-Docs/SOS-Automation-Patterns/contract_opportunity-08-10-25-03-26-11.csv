Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.3.4.1   NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG - Manufacture of this item requires vendor certification in accordance with NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG.3.4.2    ;Submarine outboard cable assembly that must be in compliance with molding manual NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG.

The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of anyinspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformancedoes not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.4.4   Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders)  Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government duringthe performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies.5.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Design, Manufacture, and Performance - Except as modified herein, the TUBE,COMMUNICATION furnished under this contract/purchase order shall meet the design, manufacture, and performance requirements specified on drawing ;10001 2526778; cage ; . 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled &quot;Configuration Management&quot;, Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor&#39;s request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a &quot;Warning Plate&quot; stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor&#39;s overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5. PACKAGING 5.1 Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking - Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking shall be in accordance with the Contract/Purchase Order Schedule and as specified below.

The increase in production will cover JASSM production lots 27-31 and LRASM lots 13-17. The program office is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statements from potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small business that are capable of providing JASSM and LRASM. This effort also includes sustainment efforts to include operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness. The objective of this sources sought notification is to determine what resources are available to perform this specific type of requirement. In addition to the JASSM/LRASM missile hardware and software, this weapon system includes telemetry instrumentation kits, precision targeting image software, the JASSM/LRASM Weapon System Simulators, technical data, obsolescence management, upgrades, production implementation, pre-planned product improvement, sustainment, aircraft integration, non-warranty repair, containers, and other related items. Associated support items include, but are not limited to, replacement parts, program management, engineering, logistics, test support, support equipment, software/hardware upgrades to support production missiles, associated data, and any other supplies or services needed to sustain the program over the life of the system, as well as all facilities, equipment, labor, tools and test equipment. Sustainment activities include JASSM/LRASM system repair, container requirements, and repairable/replaceable components of these end items plus the repair infrastructure; and any other supplies or services needed to sustain the JASSM/LRASM program over the life of the system. Repair infrastructure includes program management, replacement parts, special tooling maintenance, business management, hardware demilitarization/disposal and administrative support. Sustainment requirements are anticipated to include the capability and capacity to repair non-warranted missiles and other support items that may occur proportional to the estimated increased missile quantities listed above. The fulfillment of the supplies/services listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture and production. As Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control&rsquo;s obligations under existing contracts continue, any Government-owned peculiar equipment will not be available to any second source.
All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide the missiles, associated support, and sustainment in increased quantities to the Primary Point of Contact listed below.

The full    NSN is now 5841-016193389.Accordingly, the solicitation closing date is amended from May 5 2025 to       August 6 2025.\For Critical Safety Items (CSI), DFARS clause 252.209-7010, Identification of Critical Safety Items, is incorporated by reference.For items for which Government inspection and acceptance will be conducted at the source, DLAD clause 52.?-9004, Product Verification Testing, is incorporated by reference.  DLAD clauses can be viewed at http://www.dla.mil/Acquisition/Pages/DLAD.aspx.As applicable, DFARS clause 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, is incorporated by reference.THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED UNDER SEPA AUTHORITY; Synopsis is waived based on urgency (FAR 5.202(a)(2)).Offerors are advised that offers received from sources which are not government-approved sources of supply will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore ineligible for award. Any distributors of approved source(s) MUST submit a copy of their authorizeddistributor letter, on the source's letterhead, to the buyer point of contact indicated on the solicitation via email, at time of proposal submittal.This item can be procured only from suppliers who provide FAA-Certified parts which possess an FAA Authorized Release Certificate, FAA Form 8130-3 Airworthy Approval Tag.NAVSUP WSS Code N2 has determined that the requirements at DFARS 211.274 whichmandates the use of DFARS clause 252.211-7003 ""Item Unique                 Identification and Valuation"" in all solicitations and contracts, be deleted from all non-CLSSAFMS sparesrequirements processed by NAVSUP WSS and       DLA-Aviation. The affected parts are wholly owned by FMS customer countries, arenot covered by a Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Arrangement (CLSSA), thesesame assets will be delivered to the customer country for their sole use.The IUID definition at DFARS 211.274-1 says IUID ""is a system of marking,   valuing and  tracking items delivered to DoD."" These spares are non-CLSSA FMS assets and will never be delivered to DoD. The assets are delivered to a     domestic U.S. freight forwarderwho is under contract by the FMS customer to  ship the assets to the country of record.The FMS customer countries retain ownership of their parts throughout the     asset's lifecycle. These parts will never be owned by the U.S. Government, and will never be entered into the DoD supply chain. Based on this, there is no needfor these non-CLSSA FMScountry assets to be specially marked for tracking by DoD.\",97AS,SPRPA1,"DLA AVIATION AT PHILADELPHIA, PA",5c3078fccc7c481aa7d7ce27131e506c,ALEXA.KOLB@DLA.MIL,ALEXA.KOLB@DLA.MIL,2025-08-06 11:04:19.786000+00:00,2025-08-06 11:04:19.736000+00:00,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/SPRPA125QEL41-Solicitation-e506c,https://sam.gov/opp/a11e3bd6109b477394c7427dc8ad3ac2/view

N00421-25-WPM202-RFI-NACES-SKU-10,RFI FOR STATE OF THE ART SURVIVAL ITEMS SUITABLE FOR CONTAINMENT IN THE SKU-10 SEAT KIT ASSEMBLY ON TACTICAL AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH THE NAVAL AVIATION COMMON EJECTION SEAT (NACES),"To promote early exchanges of information with Industry in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.2, Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Systems (NAVAIR PMA202) of Patuxent River, Maryland is issuing this Request for Information (RFI).  NAVAIR is requesting information to identify qualified sources to provide commercially available survival items for Navy and Marine Corps aircrew flying in F/A-18 and EA-18 aircraft.  The requirements for these items are provided below.  Interested parties are invited to describe their capabilities to provide the product as described herein. The Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated for the capability to meet the desired performance requirements listed below and the table listing key system attributes. 

A twofold focus exists for this effort.  First, identify a water source that will extend survival in a maritime environment (single person life raft) with a threshold of 7 days and an objective of 14 days.  For each 24-hour period, a minimum of 64 ounces of water should be produced and able to be stored within the confines of a single person life raft.  The form factor has a threshold of being able to be packed in the SKU-10 survival seat kit in a space 6 inches by 14 by 4 inches (336 square inches overall).  It cannot exceed 2 pounds.  It must have a shelf life of no less than two (2) years.  Additionally, energy sources will be Key System Attributes and can be accommodated by the aircrew in pockets on their flight gear.  Total weight cannot exceed five (5) pounds.  Pocket size is defined as 6.5 inches in width by 8 inches in length and 1 inch depth. Any pockets must securely close with a zipper or similar closure system to prevent items from falling out and creating foreign object damage to the aircraft.  Resistance to saltwater intrusion is a required characteristic. 

The Navy plans to approve COTS items that meet user requirements for local procurement by squadrons as required for mission needs.  Cost will be a consideration in determining COTS items approved for use. A cost benefit discussion regarding adding these item(s) to the federal supply system will occur.  Multiple items could be approved if found to be acceptable.

Interested parties are invited to describe their capabilities as well as provide samples as described herein.  In response to this RFI, please provide specification sheets showing the &ldquo;designed to&rdquo; standards.  Please limit your RFI responses 5 pages.  The product sample as well as product information shall be submitted at no expense to the Government.  The samples and corresponding information will not be returned.  It is also requested that pricing be included with the submitted product and information.   Proprietary data MUST be marked on a page-by-page basis, and will be kept confidential and protected in accordance with the Uniform Trades Secret Act. 

Key System Attributes, Thresholds, and Test Methods

Key System Attribute 1: Water production should be through a process of osmosis. With a focus on energy exerted and perspiration by the aircrew, forward osmosis is a preferred solution. A hydration gel could be evaluated but must fit the form factor. All proposed solutions must fit the form factor noted above with a shelf life of not less than 2 years.

Key System Attribute 1 Threshold: A minimum of 7 days of capability must exist. Must be compatible with available space in the SKU-10 seat kit assembly.

Key System Attribute 1 Test Method: Demonstration/user evaluation; analysis of provided specification



Key System Attribute 2: A food or energy source should provide at least 2,000 calories per day and meet the form factor noted above.  It must have a shelf life of not less than 2 years.

Key System Attribute 2 Threshold: A minimum of 2000 calories per serving with a sufficient number of servings to address a survival scenario of 7 days.

Key System Attribute 2 Test Method: Analysis; user evaluation



Key System Attribute 3: Both water and food/energy packaging must be waterproof and not impacted by exposure to salt water.

Key System Attribute 3 Threshold: Impervious to saltwater intrusion. 

Key System Attribute 3 Test Method: User evaluation; lab quantification of percent salt intrusion.

Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa.  17055-0788.)3.3.1   Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders untilanother drawing revision is approved.  The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted,the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority.        Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below.        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

FMS Aircraft Program Request for Information (RFI):  



Information obtained from industry&rsquo;s response to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. The program&rsquo;s Period of Performance (POP) should not exceed 28 months &ndash; 32 months after contract award. 



Requirements for Commercial Aircraft and Support Items: 




	
	Background 
	



	
	A Partner Nation (PN) previously procured five (5) AC-208 Cessna Caravans through U.S. Foreign Military Sales. The AC-208&rsquo;s were procured to provide the partner with a single, organic asset that can find, fix, and finish enemy combatants in one package. The aircraft has similar capabilities to the MQ-9 in terms of finding targets with a high-fidelity targeting pod, launching hellfire missiles at targets, and having an extended loiter time to remain on station. Current operations have shifted away from overt signatures and buildings to personnel hiding in obscure environments.  
	



	
	Upon completion of the upgrade, the PN desires the capability to gain Positive Identification (PID) of individual people with fidelity beyond 1.5 kilometers (km). Current capabilities require the aircrew to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; the target by flying directly overhead. After flying overhead to gain PID (inside the AGM-114 Hellfire minimum launch range), the aircraft must execute a turn away from the target to build enough range for an attack run-in within the hellfire weapons employment zone, at which point the target is no longer visible. This was verified by a senior U.S. pilot (with over 2,000 hours of experience as an evaluator/instructor in fighter and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft) flying onboard the AC-208. Recent missions highlight the PN&rsquo;s desire to use the AC-208 as their primary strike platform, but it is only successfully utilized on targets that can be acquired beyond three nautical miles (e.g. 04APR25 VBIED strike). 
	







	
	Details of the Request 
	



	
	The PN requests procurement, integration and installation of the following components onto each of their five (5) AC-208 Combat Caravan light-attack, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) aircraft: 
	



	
	Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) airborne surveillance and reconnaissance turret  
	



	
	Multiple Processing Units (MPU) 
	



	
	Video Switch Matrix Units 
	



	
	7&rdquo; Flip Up Display Monitors 
	



	
	Technical Manuals Updates 
	



	
	Familiarization/Differences Training on Component Upgrades:  
	



	
	2-week training program for 10 individuals, focused on new features and functionalities by the hardware upgrades. The underlying software and system functionality will remain unchanged.  
	



	
	Operational Framework 
	



	
	An assessment of current fleet configuration.     
	



	
	An airworthiness Type Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the equipment being installed. The approval from the FAA is required prior to the installation.  
	



	
	Installation and integration of components onto the aircraft must be performed at the customer&rsquo;s Main Operating Base (MOB) in an austere location. 
	



	
	Customer requires that 80% of the operational fleet (4/5 aircraft) must always be available for operations, so installation must be done sequentially

N6660420DQ000,N66604-20-D-Q000 SubHDR Repair Contract,"The following notice serves as a request for information (RFI) prepared in accordance with DFARS PGI 206.302-1 and a proposed contract action synopsis prepared in accordance with FAR 5.2 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

This is a synopsis/RFI for an Ordering Period extension modification to Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 awarded on a sole source basis to Raytheon Company (hereafter referred to as &quot;RTX&quot;) on 24 September 2020.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 is 334511; the size standard is 1,350 employees.

Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 is for Testing, Inspection and Evaluation (TI&amp;E), maintenance, repair, upgrade, and restoration or replacement of SubHDR Mast Antenna Lowest Repairable Units (LRUs).

The purpose of the proposed modification is to extend the ordering period from 23 September 2025 to 23 September 2027. This is necessary in order to utilize the remaining ceiling and prevent a gap in services while a follow-on contract is established. The scope of the types of services and supplies and the contract ceiling will remain unchanged. 

For this proposed contract action, the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. As established in Justification &amp; Approval number 17030.1, approved prior to the award of N66604-20-D-Q000, RTX is the only responsible source that has completed functional, performance, and environmental qualifications of the SubHDR MG LRUs and subcomponents.  Due to the complex nature of the SubHDR MG, the environmentally challenging underwater outboard use, and the rigorous certification criteria for SubHDR MGs, LRUs and subcomponents, RTX is the only source that currently possesses the knowledge and expertise required to perform the TI&amp;Es and RUORs.  This ordering period extension modification is required in order to allow for the continued performance of the TI&amp;Es and RUORs. Failure to do so will result in a gap in contractual coverage that will jeopardize continuity of services, program stability, and mission readiness. Additionally, it would also result in unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The place of performance is at the Contractor&rsquo;s site, Marlborough, MA.

The modification is expected to be awarded on or around 23 September 2025.

The synopsis/RFI is not a request for competitive proposals. This requirement is being posted to maximize communication with industry. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not delay award for consideration of capability statements submitted.

Information shall be submitted prior to 13 August 2025 via email to ALL of the following points of contact:

The explanation ofabbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423.Block A:  Is the actual contract line item no.Block B:  Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s)          which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase          order.Block C:  Is the category of data required, TDP is defined          in MIL-T-31000.  TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B          of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's          included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as          NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals          without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,          most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP.Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item          being purchased.Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,          invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and          monitoring purposes.Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code.Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the          individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the          requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP).Block H:  Self explanatory.Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content          and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP.Block J:  Self explanatory.Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN).Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4.Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if          the title requires clarification.Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual          Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event          the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered          TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order.Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement          statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found.Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,          conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item.Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and          acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the          codes is as follows:              DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                    SS               (1)           (2)                    DD               (3)           (4)                    SD               (1)           (4)                    DS               (3)           (5)                    LT               (6)           (7)                    NO               (8)           (8)                    XX               (9)           (9)          (1)  Inspection at source.          (2)  Acceptance at source.          (3)  No inspection performed at source.

The Government quality assurance               representative shall be listed on the distribution               in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via               the quality assurance letter of inspection.               Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising               final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical               Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of               preliminary TDP's or TM's).          (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.          (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or               letter of transmittal required.               Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising               Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.          (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere               in the contract.Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring          specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of          the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""          in this field.  This data item requires submission of a          preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.          When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD          Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government          approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the          contractor to resubmit the data after Government          approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also          indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,          approval of technical content and/or format.Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the          Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition          of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:          A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.          B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.          C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with              a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the              DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,              Mich. or Government activities.          D.

That specific            information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423.Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to            be submitted.  When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted            Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.            (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.)Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required           by Block 14.Block 16:  Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information           Blocks 1 through 15.  This block is also the only area used to           tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the           minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are           allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for           delivery of the data.Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the           appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:           A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this               type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price               would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General               and Administrative (G&A) and profit.           B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be               reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.               The price for data in this group would be based on the direct               cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and               to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.           C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own               use and which requires no substantial change to conform to               Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,               frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only               the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,               G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.           D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part               of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required               and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally               be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual               developed for commercial application which will be acquired               in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify               the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go               with the acquisition.Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total           price which is estimated to be attributable to the production           or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE           ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable.6.3  In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the informationcontained on those documents and drawings.  There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings.
