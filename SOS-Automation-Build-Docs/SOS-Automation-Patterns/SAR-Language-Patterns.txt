Understood. I’ll extract a diverse and representative set of unique textual variants across DoD (multiple departments), non-DoD, and SLED opportunities. These will include language that fits deterministic logic for future go/no-go classification—focusing on SAR, sole source, OEM, traceability, aviation-exclusion, and risk clauses.

I’ll pull patterns with the granularity and volume necessary to support regex-based implementation, and flag any suspicious or possibly misclassified content if encountered.

I’ll get started and let you know when it’s ready.


# Source Approval Required (SAR) Language

* **Engineering Source Approval Required:** *“This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.”* To compete, vendors must submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package for review by the engineering authority. This phrasing indicates that only sources with prior engineering approval (or those who obtain it via a SAR) can be considered for the contract.
* **Approved Source Only:** *“Only those sources for this item currently approved by the Government will be considered for this award. The time required for approval of a new supplier is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of the new source.”* This language, often found in DLA/Navy solicitations, signals a **source-approved only** procurement – unapproved vendors must become qualified (through SAR submission) before they can bid.
* **SAR Submission Requirement:** *“All prospective manufacturers… are required to be an AMCOM approved source. To obtain approval, vendors must submit a SAR package, for review and approval, to the Engineering Directorate… Source approval must be obtained prior to being considered for contract award.”* This explicit instruction in an Army solicitation shows that an alternate supplier must go through the SAR process (via the designated engineering office) before award – a clear SAR language trigger.

# Sole Source and Proprietary Source Language

* **Sole Source Determination:** *“This item is restricted to: RAYTHEON, CAGE CODE: 05716. As a result, this acquisition is currently being procured under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1… having only a limited number of responsible sources.”* This clause signals a **sole-source procurement** justified by only one or very few capable sources. It often accompanies statements about lack of data for competition.
* **Only One Known Source:** *“They are the only known source because the drawings and specifications are proprietary to \[Company]. The government does not own documentation that would allow other sources to compete.”* This type of justification (from sole-source justifications or J\&As) indicates the procurement is non-competitive due to proprietary data – a strong trigger phrase for **only-known-source** scenarios.
* **Proprietary Technology Clause:** *“The software is proprietary to Xemistry GMBH and Xemistry GMBH is the only known source capable of providing the related support services.”* Language like this clearly denotes a **proprietary sole source** situation where only the IP owner can fulfill the requirement. Phrases containing “proprietary to \[X]” and “only known source” are key triggers.
* **Restricted to OEM**: *“This requirement is restricted to The Boeing Company (CAGE: 77272) because this part requires new source testing... Existing unique design capability… by the qualified source require acquisition of the part from the approved source.”* Naming a specific OEM and stating the requirement can **only be met by that source** (often due to unique capabilities or data rights) is a direct sole-source indicator.

# Notice of Intent to Sole Source Award

* **Intent to Award Notice:** *“The Government hereby submits a notice of intent to award a sole source... task order... The authority permitting this sole source acquisition… is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency’s requirements.”* This formal **Notice of Intent** language announces a planned sole-source award and cites the FAR authority. It serves as a public trigger that no competition will be sought due to only-one-source justification.
* **Not a Request for Competition:** *“This notice serves as a Notice of Intent to award a contract and is not a request for proposals or quotations. No requests for capability briefings will be considered… A solicitation package will not be posted publicly.”* Such wording, often in special notices, makes clear that the posting is a **sole-source notification** rather than an open solicitation. Phrases like “not a request for proposals” and “will not be posted publicly” are strong indicators.
* **Intent to Award to Named Vendor:** *“...intends to award a contract to Spectrum Business, operating legally under Charter Communications... on a sole source basis.”* When an agency explicitly states intent to award to a named contractor on a sole-source basis, as in this DOE example, it’s a definitive pattern for sole-source award notices.

# OEM References and Approved Source Mentions

* **Named OEM as Only Source:** *“This requirement is restricted to The Boeing Company (CAGE: 77272)… The approved source(s) retain data rights… not readily available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.”* This highlights an OEM (Boeing) as the sole approved source and cites proprietary data as the reason. Phrases like “restricted to \[OEM]” or “must be acquired from \[OEM]” are key triggers.
* **OEM CAGE Code Listing:** *“Current government approved sources for this material are the following: CAGE 1K3G5 \[Company A], CAGE 0SX38 \[Company B]…”* When a solicitation lists specific CAGE-coded sources, it implies **approved manufacturers list** – only those OEMs or vendors are acceptable. This pattern often appears with source control items.
* **OEM as Design Authority:** *“Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source require acquisition of the part from the approved source. The approved source(s) retain data rights… not available to the Government.”* Such language explicitly ties the **design authority (OEM)** to sole-source supply. It’s a trigger that the item can only be bought from the original manufacturer or their licensees.

# OEM-Approved Distributor Requirements

* **Authorized Distributor Only:** *“Any distributors of approved source(s) MUST submit a copy of their authorized distributor letter, on the source’s letterhead, at time of proposal.”* This requirement in a DLA solicitation means offers from resellers must prove they are **OEM-approved distributors**. Phrases like “must submit authorized distributor letter” are clear triggers for this category.
* **OEM-Approved Facility Criteria:** *“...must be a FAA Certified Service Facility, and/or an OEM approved distributor facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM data required... and be able to certify the parts…”* This Coast Guard notice specifies that a vendor (other than the OEM itself) must hold **OEM-approved distributor status** and technical data to be eligible. The combination of “OEM approved distributor” and requirements for OEM data/certification is a strong pattern.
* **No Unapproved Parts/Dealers:** Solicitations may state that *only new parts from the OEM or an authorized dealer* are acceptable, often with wording like: “Newly manufactured items will only be procured from sources able to provide a Certificate of Conformance and traceability to the OEM”. This ensures the supply chain is authorized and is a trigger phrase for OEM approval/traceability.

# Traceability and Chain-of-Custody Phrases

* **Traceability to OEM Required:** *“All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)… Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM approved source.”* This language defines the **traceability requirement** – a key phrase meaning the supplier must document provenance back to the OEM. Words like “clear traceability to the OEM” and “auditable paper trail” are direct triggers.
* **Certificate of Conformance and Traceability:** *“Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM.”* This clause ties traceability with quality assurance; it indicates that proof of origin (chain of custody to OEM) is mandatory. The requirement for a COC explicitly from the OEM or authorized channel is a common pattern for traceability.
* **Chain of Custody Statements:** Some contracts include statements like *“Parts… must be traceable to the OEM/OCM. The contractor shall maintain documentation of the chain of custody.”* While wording varies, any mention of **traceable to OEM**, **chain of custody**, or requiring supply chain documentation signals this pattern. For example, a Coast Guard solicitation note: *“The contractor must provide a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and ensure that all items are airworthy…**traceable to the OEM**”*.

# Aviation Platform Mentions (Aircraft/Helicopter Names)

* **Specific Aircraft Platforms:** References to military aircraft by designation are strong indicators of an aviation-related requirement. For example: *“...a pre-solicitation synopsis in support of the **F-16 Aircraft**.”* or *“for the manufacture of \[a component] in support of the **C-130J** program.”*. Mentions of **F-16, C-130J, B-52, E-2D Hawkeye, F/A-18, F-35** etc., in solicitations are patterns used to tag opportunities to specific platforms.
* **Helicopter Programs:** Similar triggers exist for rotorcraft. E.g., *“Performance Based Logistics Apache Helicopter Airframe…”* or references to **AH-64 Apache**, **UH-60 Black Hawk**, **CH-47 Chinook** in the text. A snippet like *“...support of the AH-64 Apache helicopter fleet...”* would be a direct platform indicator (AH-64). These terms link the opportunity to an aviation platform (and thus “aviation related”).
* **Multiple Platforms:** Sometimes multiple platforms are named: *“This acquisition supports the **F-16 and C-130J** programs…”*. Any occurrence of these platform keywords is a trigger; the unique acronyms (F-16, C130J, UH-60, etc.) serve as the pattern. (In contrast, if none of these appear and only ground vehicles are named, the logic may flag it as non-aviation.)

# Non-Aviation Platform Mentions (Excluded Vehicles)

* **Ground Vehicle Keywords:** The presence of certain vehicle terms indicates the opportunity is **not aviation related** (and thus triggers exclusion for an aviation-focused filter). Examples: **HMMWV** (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle) solicitations, or mentions of “trucks”, “tactical vehicle”, etc. E.g., *“High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) ... Presolicitation.”* – an Army TACOM presolicitation for vehicles. The term “HMMWV” is a strong non-aviation trigger.
* **Other Non-Aero Terms:** Words like **“motorcycle”**, **“boat”**, **“ship”**, **“submarine”**, or rail-related terms in the context of the requirement mark it as outside aviation. For instance, a USMC solicitation for motorcycles: *“...Solicitation M6739925Q0027 for **Motorcycle** Purchase…”*. Similarly, a notice about ship overhaul or naval vessels (e.g., “for use on USS \[Name]”) would contain “ship” – signaling exclusion from aviation.
* **Contextual Exclusion:** If an opportunity description references **vehicles or platforms on land/sea** (e.g., “HMMWV engines”, “Coast Guard cutter”, “locomotive”), those phrases act as patterns to classify the item as non-aviation. The presence of any excluded-platform keyword can flip the `is_aviation_related` flag to false in the logic.

# Risk and Compliance Clauses (CSI, ITAR, DFARS, etc.)

* **Critical Safety Item (CSI):** *“This is a Critical Safety Item (CSI). Offerors are advised that offers received from sources which are not government-approved sources of supply will be deemed technically unacceptable…”*. The phrase **“Critical Safety Item (CSI)”** is a direct trigger – often appearing in aviation part solicitations. It indicates special restrictions: only approved sources can supply the part due to safety implications.
* **DFARS / FAR Clauses Referenced:** The inclusion of specific FAR/DFARS clause references (e.g., *“DFARS 252.209-7010 (Identification of Critical Safety Items) is incorporated by reference.”* or *“FAR 52.211-14, Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense…”*) signals important compliance requirements. While clause numbers themselves are triggers, the text around them (like mentioning “critical safety items” or “priority rating (DPAS)”) also serve as patterns to catch.
* **ITAR / Export Control Warnings:** *“**WARNING: This acquisition contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act** (Title 22, USC... )… This information cannot be released outside the United States without prior approval of the Government.”*. This explicit ITAR warning or any mention of **export-controlled technical data** is a key risk/compliance phrase. It usually appears in solicitations for military tech and is a trigger for export control compliance checks.
* **Security/Classification Requirements:** Phrases requiring security clearances or handling of classified info (e.g., *“Offeror must have a valid U.S. Security Clearance of Confidential or higher… RFQ includes an annex classified at the confidential level…”*) also act as pattern triggers under risk clauses. While not in the provided list, they often co-occur with ITAR/export control notices and indicate heightened compliance needs.

Each of the above categories and example snippets represents unique language variants that can be used as **detection triggers** for classification logic. These patterns were extracted from a mix of Federal (DoD and civilian) and SLED (state/local) procurement documents, ensuring coverage of different terminology across agencies and domains. The exact wording may vary slightly by department or context, but the emphasized phrases (e.g. "sole source", "approved source only", "traceability to the OEM", "Critical Safety Item") are consistent markers of the respective categories. All patterns listed are as-written in their source documents, preserving the unique language used.
