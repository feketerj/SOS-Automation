# Exact Language from U.S. Government Solicitations on Technical Data Availability

## Research scope and limitations

This research targeted exact quotes from real U.S. government solicitations across USAF, Navy, Army, DLA, NASA, and Coast Guard. **Critical limitation**: Direct access to most current SAM.gov solicitations was restricted, limiting the ability to extract the targeted 25 trigger and 10 exception quotes per service. The quotes below represent what was accessible through public sources, SBIR databases, and procurement documentation.

## TRIGGERS - Government lacks technical data

### U.S. Air Force / Air Force Materiel Command

**Quote 1** - Hill AFB/AFMC Sources Sought (F2DCCE5) - 2014:
> "These assemblies are proprietary to GE Intelligent Platforms Embedded Systems, Inc.; the Government doesn't own data rights so no schematics can be provided."

**Quote 2** - B-2 Heat Exchanger Reverse Engineering Solicitation (beta.SAM.gov):
> "This engineering effort is to reverse engineer the core of the B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers, develop disassembly process to remove defective cores, develop a stacking, vacuum brazing, and welding process to manufacture new heat exchanger cores and to develop a welding process to install the new cores on existing B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers. The requirement includes reverse-engineering the re‐core process for the B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers."

**Quote 3** - DLA Nuclear Enterprise Support Office SBIR (DLA183-001):

**Quote 5** - Hill AFB Reverse Engineering RFI:
> "Various components of the KC-135, F107, and T-38 family of aircraft are in need or upgrade or replacement. The Department of the Air Force/Air Force Materiel Command has requested information on companies capable of reverse engineering such components and providing Complete Technical Data Package and Prototypes."

**Quote 6** - F107 Engine SBIR Solicitation:
> "The engine is no longer supported by the OEM, and sources of supply are needed for many near-term components. Some components cannot be sourced, so replacement procedures cannot be utilized, hindering the support to the fleet."

**Quote 7** - Air Force Contract FA864923P0345 (SBIR Data Rights):

**Quote 2** - NAVAIR P-8A Systems:
> "A competitive acquisition would introduce a new system to the field that may not be integrated and interoperable with the existing systems due to the restricted rights and limited data rights that resulted from the original competitive award"

**Quote 3** - NAVAIR P-8A Boeing Sole Source:
> "only Boeing possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights of the design required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver P-8A training systems"

**Quote 4** - NAVAIR P-8A Aircraft Data:

## Critical access limitations

The research was significantly limited by:

1. **SAM.gov authentication barriers** - Most current solicitations require authorized access
2. **Robots.txt restrictions** - Many government sites blocked automated searches
3. **Document format issues** - PDFs not indexed by search engines
4. **Classification/ITAR restrictions** - Some technical data solicitations have restricted access
5. **Archive limitations** - Historical solicitations (2019-2025) not readily accessible

## Recommendations for comprehensive data collection

To obtain the full target of 25+ trigger and 10+ exception quotes per service:

1. **Direct SAM.gov access** with proper authentication credentials
2. **Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests** for specific solicitation documents
3. **Defense contracting association memberships** for database access
4. **Government contracting databases** (GovWin, Federal Compass) with paid subscriptions
5. **Direct contact** with agency contracting offices (AFMC, NAVAIR, TACOM, etc.)
6. **Industry partner collaboration** with defense contractors who have solicitation access

The quotes provided represent authentic government solicitation language but fall short of the comprehensive dataset originally requested due to access limitations. The patterns and language identified can serve as a foundation for RegEx pattern development, though additional data collection through authorized channels would significantly enhance pattern accuracy and coverage.
