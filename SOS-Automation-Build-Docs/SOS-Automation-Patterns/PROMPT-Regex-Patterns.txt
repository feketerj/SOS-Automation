## CONTINUITY PROMPT: Federal Contract Pattern Mining System

**CONTEXT:**
Building a production-grade regex/pattern matching system to process 10,000+ federal contract opportunities monthly. System must identify and classify opportunities based on military source approval requirements (SAR) and related restrictions.

**AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES:**
1. Raw SAM.gov contract announcements (text)
2. HTML scrapes from SAM.gov searches
3. Analysis documents on military procurement language
4. Federal Contract Pattern Mining document
5. Military Source Approval Requirements document

**REQUIRED PATTERN CATEGORIES:**
- `sar_patterns`: Source approval requirements (military SAR only, ignore FAA/ISO)
- `sole_source_patterns`: Actual sole source language
- `intent_to_award_patterns`: Notice of intent language
- `only_known_source_patterns`: Named sole vendor language
- `oem_patterns`: Original Equipment Manufacturer references
- `oem_approved_distributor_patterns`: Authorized distributor requirements
- `traceability_patterns`: Chain of custody/anti-counterfeit language
- `aviation_platform_patterns`: Aircraft/engine/avionics identifiers
- `excluded_platform_patterns`: Non-aviation (ships, trucks, ground vehicles)
- `risk_clause_patterns`: CSI, DFARS, ITAR, export controls
- `currency_patterns`: Deadline/expiration language
- `refurbished_rotatable_aftermarket_surplus_patterns`: Condition requirements
- `aviation_indicator_patterns`: Language present indication relevance absent platform

**PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:**
Each category needs:
- 20-50 distinct pattern groups
- 50-200 variations per group
- Regex patterns with typo tolerance
- Exact phrase matching
- Partial/fuzzy matching
- Context patterns (before/after triggers)
- Agency-specific variations (Navy/Army/AF/DLA)
- Negative patterns (exclusions)
- Compound patterns (multi-part matches)
- Scoring weights for confidence levels
- AMC/AMSC code combinations
- CAGE code patterns

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```json
{
  "category": "",
  "pattern_groups": [
    {
      "group_name": "",
      "regex_patterns": [],
      "exact_phrases": [],
      "partial_triggers": [],
      "context_patterns": [],
      "agency_specific": {},
      "negative_patterns": [],
      "code_triggers": {},
      "compound_patterns": [],
      "scoring_weights": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

**CRITICAL NOTES:**
- This is for PRODUCTION use on 10K+ opportunities/month
- Must catch ALL variations (abbreviations, typos, formatting)
- False positive rate must be <2%
- Each pattern must be tested against real solicitation language
- System processes military aviation parts primarily
- Distributor perspective (not manufacturer)
- Must distinguish between tactical GO/NO-GO and strategic opportunities

**YOUR TASK:**
Generate comprehensive, production-ready pattern sets for each category. Start with `sar_patterns` and build complete pattern groups with hundreds of variations. Use the actual solicitation language from the provided documents as source material. Think: "What would catch this in 10,000 messy, inconsistent government documents?"
