DLAD clauses can be viewed athttp://www.dla.mil/Acquisition/Pages/DLAD.aspx.As applicable, DFARS clause 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, isincorporated by reference.THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED UNDER EMERGENCY ACQUISITION FLEXIBILITIES AUTHORITY; Synopsis is waived based on urgency (FAR 5.202(a)(2)).All potential offers shall provide newly manufactured spares only. Refurbished, remanufactured, or repaired material will not be acceptable;Offers for such are ineligible for award.Offerors are advised that offers received from sources which are not government-approved sources of supply will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore ineligible for award. Any distributors of approved source(s) MUST submit a copy of their authorizeddistributor letter, on the source's letterhead, to the buyer point of contact indicated on the solicitation via email, at time of proposal submittal.NAVSUP WSS Code N2 has determined that the requirements at DFARS 211.274 whichmandates the use of DFARS clause 252.211-7003 ""Item UniqueIdentification and Valuation"" in all solicitations and contracts, be deleted from all non-CLSSAFMS spares requirements processed by NAVSUP WSS and       DLA-Aviation. The affected parts are wholly owned by FMS customer countries, arnot covered by a CooperativeLogistics Supply Support Arrangement (CLSSA), thessame assets will be delivered to the customer country for their sole use.The IUID definition at DFARS 211.274-1 says IUID ""is a system of marking,   valuing and  tracking items delivered to DoD."" These spares are non-CLSSA FMS assets and will never be delivered to DoD. The assets are delivered to a     domestic U.S. freight forwarderwho is under contract by the FMS customer to  ship the assets to the country of record.The FMS customer countries retain ownership of their parts throughout the     asset's lifecycle.These parts will never be owned by the U.S. Government, and                    will never be entered into the DoD supply chain. Based on this, there is no need for these non-CLSSA FMS country assets to be specically marked for tracking by DoD.\",DLA Aviation,2025-07-23 11:05:24.213000+00:00,2025-07-23,2025-08-22 20:30:00+00:00,2025-08-22,America/New_York,Solicitation,,336413,Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing ,1650,"Aircraft Hydraulic, Vacuum and De-icing System Components",,Telephone: 2157376835,KAILEIGH.BLAKER@DLA.MIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,97AS,SPRPA1,"DLA AVIATION AT PHILADELPHIA, PA",44466b47a82149f3b8f6a693cbf02bc4,KAILEIGH.BLAKER@DLA.MIL,KAILEIGH.BLAKER@DLA.MIL,2025-07-23 11:05:24.213000+00:00,2025-07-23 11:05:24.157000+00:00,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/SPRPA125QET20-Solicitation-02bc4,https://sam.gov/opp/44466b47a82149f3b8f6a693cbf02bc4/view
