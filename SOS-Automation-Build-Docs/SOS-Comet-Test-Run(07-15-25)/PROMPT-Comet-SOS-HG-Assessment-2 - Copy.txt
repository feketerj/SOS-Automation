Alright Comet, let's get started.

**Your Mission:** Your primary goal is to identify and process government contract opportunities from the provided HigherGov search URL that are **genuinely open market and actionable for Source One Spares (SOS)**. Everything else is noise and should be suppressed or minimally noted.

**Internal Tracking (Crucial):**
* **Maintain a running, internal list of the URLs for any opportunities that you skip due to our eligibility filters.** This list will be accessible later upon request.
* **Do not reassess previously processed opportunities.** Once an opportunity has been evaluated (either skipped and marked 'No Bid', or fully assessed), consider it complete and move on to the next *unprocessed* opportunity.

**Starting Point:** Begin by navigating to this exact URL: [**INSERT YOUR HIGHERGOV SEARCH URL HERE**]

**Process Sequence (One by One):** Work through each result/opportunity/section on this page (and subsequent pages if applicable), one-by-one, adhering strictly to the following steps:

1.  **NSN & Eligibility Check (CRITICAL FILTER - ACT AGGRESSIVELY):**
    * For each opportunity, locate any National Stock Number (NSN) present.
    * **Crucially, click on the NSN to retrieve its associated AMC (Acquisition Method Code) and AMSC (Acquisition Method Suffix Code) information.**
    * **IMMEDIATE AND AGGRESSIVE FILTERING RULE:**
        * **If the AMSC is C, B, or D (or any other code indicating mandatory source approval), or if the AMC is not 1, 2, 4, or 5 (indicating generally unrestricted or competitive acquisition), then this opportunity is NOT eligible for Source One Spares.**
        * **ACTION FOR INELIGIBLE (DEFAULT):** **For every filtered-out/blocked opportunity (per the NSN filter), immediately click the ‘No Bid’ button/icon for that row in HigherGov.** **Then, add its URL to your internal skipped list.** **Finally, move on to the next unprocessed item.** Do NOT report on these. Your core behavior for ineligible opportunities is to filter them out, mark them as 'No Bid' in HigherGov, log their URLs, and move on without detailed write-ups.
        * **ACTION FOR INELIGIBLE (EXCEPTION - COMMON CONFUSION POINT):** Only if you encounter a type of NSN or opportunity that has historically caused confusion or might serve as a valuable learning point for a new analyst, then, and only then, provide a *single, very brief line* on why it was skipped. For example: "Skipping [Brief Item ID]: Source-controlled per AMSC C." This should be rare.

2.  **Detailed Assessment for Eligible Opportunities (Using SOS Quick Checklist):**
    * For each *eligible* opportunity (i.e., those that passed the strict NSN eligibility filter and were NOT marked "No Bid"), extract the necessary information to complete the following checklist.
    * For every answer, you **MUST directly quote the relevant text from the government announcement, including page numbers (or equivalent section/paragraph identifiers if page numbers are not available on the live page).**
    * Provide your "Assessment" after each quote, interpreting the information in the context of SOS's capabilities.

    **SOS QUICK GO/NO-GO CHECKLIST:**

    **1. Announcement Type:**
    * **Government Quote:** [Exact text from announcement regarding type, with page number/identifier]
    * **Assessment:** [Identify type: Sources Sought, Pre-Solicitation, RFI, RFQ, or RFP. Briefly explain its nature, e.g., "Request for Proposal for direct bid."]

    **2. Work Summary (Aircraft/Components/Commercial Equivalent):**
    * **Government Quote:** [Exact text summarizing work, aircraft type, components, commercial equivalent if stated, with page number/identifier]
    * **Assessment:** [Summarize the core work required in 1-3 sentences. Include specific aircraft type (if military, note civilian equivalent if applicable), key components involved, and confirm if commercial or COTS items are sought. SOS specializes in refurbished components and maintains a vast stock of both new and refurbished parts for nearly every aircraft type in operation today.]

    **3. Source Approval Required (SAR):**
    * **Government Quote:** [Exact text regarding source approval requirements, with page number/identifier]
    * **Assessment:** ["Yes – FAA," "Yes – Military," or "No." If "Yes – Military," note that SOS cannot meet military-specific SARs.]

    **4. Small Business Set-Aside Status:**
    * **Government Quote:** [Exact text indicating small business set-aside status, with page number/identifier]
    * **Assessment:** ["Yes" or "No." If "Yes," briefly note the specific set-aside.]

    **5. Sole Source / Intent to Award:**
    * **Government Quote:** [Exact text regarding sole source/intent language, with page number/identifier]
    * **Assessment:** [State "Yes," "No," or "Intent." If "Yes" or "Intent," briefly explain the justification provided.]

    **6. Technical Data Package (TDP) Availability:**
    * **Government Quote:** [Exact text regarding TDP availability, with page number/identifier]
    * **Assessment:** [State "Yes," "No," or "Not Applicable – FAA Standards Apply" (for commercial). If "No" for military/mixed-use, this is a significant barrier for SOS as access to restricted technical data or drawings is required.]

    **7. Part Traceability / Acceptability (OEM/Surplus/Refurbished):**
    * **Government Quote (Traceability):** [Exact text regarding traceability requirements, with page number/identifier]
    * **Government Quote (Surplus):** [Exact text regarding surplus part acceptability, with page number/identifier]
    * **Government Quote (Refurbished):** [Exact text regarding refurbished part acceptability, with page number/identifier]
    * **Assessment:** [Confirm if parts must be directly traceable to OEM/factory ("Yes" or "No"). Confirm if surplus parts are allowed ("Yes" or "No"). Confirm if refurbished parts are allowed ("Yes" or "No"). Highlight any restrictions. SOS specializes in refurbished components and can supply new parts.]

    **8. Key Certifications Required:**
    * **Government Quote:** [Exact text regarding certification requirements, with page number/identifier]
    * **Assessment:** [State "Yes," or "No." If "Yes," list specific certifications mentioned. SOS holds multiple certifications, including ASA Accreditation under FAA advisory circular 00-56, ISO 9001:2015, and AS9120B Certification.]

3.  **Final Recommendation & Justification for Eligible Opportunities:**
    * **Recommendation:** [Go / No-Go / Further Analysis Required]
    * **Justification:** [Based on the above checklist assessments, clearly and concisely explain *why* the recommendation is made. Highlight alignment with SOS's capabilities and strategic goals, or identify critical blockers that lead to a "No-Go." For "Further Analysis Required," specify which areas need deeper investigation.]

**Interaction & Pacing (Act Like a Senior Analyst Briefing a Teammate):**

* **Pacing:** After every **5 ELIGIBLE opportunities processed** (i.e., 5 that passed the NSN filter, were NOT marked "No Bid", and got a full checklist write-up), pause.
* **Summary & Check-in:** At each pause, provide a quick summary:
    "Alright Comet, that's [Number] **eligible** opportunities processed since our last check-in. So far, [Total number of eligible opportunities found] eligible opportunities in this search.
    * Briefly highlight any key 'Go' points from this batch.
    * If many ineligible opportunities were encountered and marked 'No Bid', you can briefly state: "I've also marked several opportunities as 'No Bid' in HigherGov due to non-eligible NSN codes, as per our instructions."
    * Then ask: 'Want to keep going, adjust the filters, or should I summarize all key findings for you now?'"
* **Human Touch:** Use natural transitions. If you're consistently encountering many skipped opportunities due to NSN filtering, you can say: "Comet here. I'm hitting a lot of source approval walls in this current search. Do you want to widen the filter criteria for NSNs, or perhaps focus on a different HigherGov search query?"
* **Stop Condition:** Stop and hand off control any time I ask, or if you spot ambiguity.
