Based on your operational SOP and the direct government quotes extracted from the first 5 opportunities, below is the assessment using your criteria for QUICK GO, QUICK NO-GO, or NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS:

**1. POWER SUPPLY, ANTI (N0038325QH113)**
- *Assessment:* NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS  
  > Many checklist fields are met (competitive spares, FAA certification required, NSN/P/N/Commercial reference present, FAR 12 addendum cited).  
  > **Blocker:** No explicit SAR/sole source barrier, but no explicit mention of approved sources or open unrestrictive competition.  
  > **Note:** If all required fields were satisfied and no SAR or tech data restriction, this would be a GO. However, “can only be procured only from suppliers who provide FAA-Certified parts…” suggests restriction—flag for review.

**2. POWER SUPPLY, ANTI, IN REPAIR/MODIFICATION OF (N0038325QH106)**
- *Assessment:* NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS  
  > Tech data/certification requirements, ISO 9001/AS9100, NSN/Platform, and source approval control language are cited.  
  > **Blocker:** Presence of language about FAA certificate, source approval, and PCO-approval for changes means there may be SAR/approved-source restriction or approval requirements—flag for review.

**3. ADAPTER, FLUID FILTER, APPLICATION KC-46 (FD20302600076)**
- *Assessment:* QUICK NO-GO  
  > “Potential sources wishing to be qualified to perform the requirement specified above are REQUIRED to complete a Source Approval Request (SAR) package…”  
  > **Justification:** SAR present; new suppliers require lengthy approval process.

**4. TRANSPONDER, RADAR, APPLICATION KC-46 (FD20302502277)**
- *Assessment:* QUICK NO-GO  
  > “Potential sources wishing to be qualified…are REQUIRED to complete a Source Approval Request (SAR) package…”  
  > **Justification:** SAR present; new suppliers require lengthy approval process.

**5. BUTTERFLY VALVE, APPLICATION KC-46 (FD20302502279)**
- *Assessment:* QUICK NO-GO  
  > “Potential sources wishing to be qualified…are REQUIRED to complete a Source Approval Request (SAR) package…”  
  > **Justification:** SAR present; new suppliers require lengthy approval process.

**Summary:**
- **QUICK GO:** *None in this batch.*
- **QUICK NO-GO:** Adapter, Fluid Filter; Transponder, Radar; Butterfly Valve — All require SAR; not executable as a standard award without prior package/approval.
- **NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS:** Both Power Supply opportunities—competitive language but certified supplier requirements may act as a barrier depending on company’s current standing (flag for review by SME or with buyer if needed).

Based on your statement that “FAA certification is OK” and you possess FAA certification, here’s the updated assessment for the first 5 opportunities (strictly per direct government quotes, no interpretation):

**QUICK GO (No SAR/No Data Restriction/No Blocker, and you meet FAA requirement):**

- **POWER SUPPLY, ANTI (N0038325QH113):**
  - Requires: “FAA-Certified parts which possess a FAA Authorized Release Certificate, FAA Form 8130-3 Airworthy Approval Tag, from certified repair stations pursuant to 14 CFR Part 14.”  
  - **QUICK GO:** You are eligible to bid, since nothing else blocks and you fulfill the FAA cert directly quoted.

**Still NOT GO (Blocked by SAR):**

- **ADAPTER, FLUID FILTER; TRANSPONDER, RADAR; BUTTERFLY VALVE:**  
  - All require direct SAR submission per quote; FAA certification alone does not bypass SAR.  
  - **QUICK NO-GO** (“SAR present; new suppliers require lengthy approval process.”) 

**Needs Further Analysis:**

- **POWER SUPPLY, ANTI, IN REPAIR/MODIFICATION OF (N0038325QH106):**
  - Cites both: “Can only be procured only from suppliers who provide FAA-Certified parts...” **and** source approval authority language (change of source, DCA, PCO approval).  
  - If you are an approved source or the Design Control Agent (DCA), it may be a GO. Otherwise, if not approved for source, it’s a “Needs Further Analysis” — check organization standing before proceeding.

**Summary Table:**  
| Opportunity      | Status        | Reason/Blocker                    |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Power Supply, Anti (QH113)                   | QUICK GO      | FAA Cert OK, no SAR, open competitive    |
| Power Supply, Anti, In Repair (QH106)        | Needs Review  | Source approval language; FAA alone may not suffice—check approval status |
| Adapter, Fluid Filter (FD20302600076)        | NO-GO         | SAR required—lengthy process                  |
| Transponder, Radar (FD20302502277)           | NO-GO         | SAR required                                  |
| Butterfly Valve (FD20302502279)              | NO-GO         | SAR required                                  |

I have performed the requested process by returning to the main contract opportunities list, opening new eligible opportunities, and running the full eligibility/pipeline checklist through the HigherGov AI Q&A tool for each one.

**Result:**  
- I have not found any new opportunities that the HigherGov AI tool confirms as a **GO** for your pipeline (i.e., open to all responsible sources, no SAR/Sole Source/OEM/qualification restrictions blocking offer, technical fit per both the government and the Q&A output).
- Specific examples checked include:
  - “Aircraft Gearbox Assembly”: Already flagged as “No Bid” and determined to be sole source/blocker.
  - “Expeditionary Exploitation Unit ONE (EXU-1) DOMEX”: The Q&A tool analyzed all pipeline criteria and returned a strong **NO-GO** for lack of technical alignment (not in your business area, high risk, incumbent barriers)[1][2].

**Next Step:**  
I will keep searching and running the AI eligibility check for each new opportunity in the feed. I will only return when I find a new opportunity BOTH you and the HigherGov AI concur is fully pipeline eligible—a confirmed **GO**.

Would you like me to focus on any specific NAICS, agencies, or product areas as I continue, or should I keep working through the latest listings for you?

Here’s what just happened:

As you suggested, I navigated back to the contract opportunities main feed and systematically worked through the *newest* open opportunities using the HigherGov pipeline eligibility checklist and Q&A assistant, as would be required for qualification and “GO/NO-GO” analysis.

**Key findings from that process:**

- The **original opportunity you were viewing** (“Purchase of Plate Locking for the HC-144 Aircraft”) is functionally restricted to approved/authorized sources for Meggitt Aerospace. Practically, only businesses pre-approved on a product qualification list (QPL) or those able to provide full traceability/original documentation can participate. If you are not already on that list, you cannot compete for this buy without going through a lengthy approval (SAR) process—which cannot be accomplished in time for this procurement. *This is a NO-GO for pipeline inclusion* unless you are already approved.

- I then continued to the next newest eligible opportunities:
    - “Aircraft Gearbox Assembly”—designated as a sole source/limited competition procurement under FAR 6.302. Only the OEM or previously authorized contractors can supply. The Government does not own data or specs, so entry for new competitors is blocked. *This is again a NO-GO for pipeline inclusion* unless you are already the limited source or OEM.
    - “Procurement of Various Spare Parts”—not a solicitation, just a Sources Sought/Request for Information for market research. You cannot win an actual contract from this notice. *This is a NO-GO for pipeline inclusion*.

- Continuing to the first *actual solicitation* with a small business set-aside, “15--Quadrant Assembly (SPE4A725Q1286)”, I found a similar pattern: the requirement lists many specific CAGE codes as “Approved sources.” If your company is **one of the approved CAGE codes** (e.g., on the list provided in the synopsis), you can bid and this is a GO decision for your pipeline. If not, you would need to pursue Source Approval (SAR), but you would not be eligible for this solicitation cycle.

**Summary Table**

| Opportunity                | Pipeline Status         | Why                                               |
|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Plate Locking HC-144       | NO-GO (unless approved)| QPL/Approved source only, SAR needed otherwise     |
| Aircraft Gearbox Assembly  | NO-GO                  | OEM/sole source limited, new entry not feasible    |
| Various Spare Parts (MH-65)| NO-GO                  | Sources Sought notice only, not a contract         |
| Quadrant Assembly          | GO (if approved)       | If on approved list; else, NO-GO for this cycle    |

**Bottom Line:** If you are an **approved source for the required part numbers** and listed by CAGE code, you can proceed with bidding (“GO”). If not, use these to guide SAR pursuits for future buys, but do NOT add the current cycle’s buy to your pipeline as a near-term opportunity.

If you need step-by-step instructions on the SAR (Source Approval Request) process or want to confirm your CAGE code’s eligibility, let me know!

**No, this opportunity does NOT have anything to do with airplanes or aviation.**

The current opportunity you are viewing—**82 SFS Explosion Detection Equipment (FIDO) (Solicitation FA302025Q0069)**—is for the purchase of “FIDO X4 Premium Handheld Explosives Trace Detectors or Equal” for use at Sheppard AFB, Texas. The salient characteristics describe commercial handheld explosive trace detectors and related accessories, with no mention of aircraft, aviation parts/components, or aircraft support equipment.

- The required product is a device to detect explosives (for base security/bomb squad/K9, etc.), not an aircraft or aviation system, and is not for use on, in, or directly supporting airplanes.
- The location is a US Air Force Base, but the equipment is for use by a security squadron (82 SFS), not for aviation maintenance or flight operations.

**Key points:**
- Not an airplane or aerospace equipment contract—purely security/force protection
- *Small business set-aside status is present but not a limiting factor for your eligibility*
- If you are seeking only aviation or aerospace-related opportunities, this is NOT a match.

Let me know if you want to move to the *next* eligible opportunity and check only for aviation or aircraft-related requirements, regardless of the set-aside!

Here is a **legitimate aircraft/aviation opportunity** that is actually relevant to a company like Source One Spares:

### Procurement of Honeywell Spares for HC130-J
**Solicitation ID:** 70Z03825QH0000048  
**Agency:** U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center  
**NAICS:** 336413 – Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing  
**PSC:** 2835 – Gas Turbines And Jet Engines  
**Aircraft Program:** HC-130J  
**Deadline:** July 24, 2025, 1:00 p.m. EDT

**Opportunity Summary:**
- **Clearly aviation/aircraft related:** This is for spare parts used in the U.S. Coast Guard’s HC-130J aircraft.
- **Scope:** Brand name procurement (strictly Honeywell OEM parts, with required CAGE codes listed for multiple Honeywell Aerospace locations).
- **Requirements:** All parts must be traceable to Honeywell (clear, auditable OEM trace required), and comply with FAA guidelines for safety of flight. **No substitutes or alternate part numbers accepted.**
- **No SAR, QPL, or “approved source” list exclusion:** While OEM traceability is required, there’s **no SAR/sole source/QPL exclusionary language** that blocks new vendors from submitting, as long as you can provide documentation for your Honeywell-sourced parts.
- **Open to all responsible sources** able to meet these requirements (8 bidders so far).

**Key notes:**  
- You must be able to demonstrate direct supply chain traceability back to Honeywell for every part bid (this is standard for aircraft safety-critical parts, not some artificial barrier).
- **You do NOT need to be a special “approved” vendor beyond traceability/COC and FAA compliance.**
- If you regularly source, resell, or broker genuine Honeywell aircraft parts—**this is a directly actionable, competitive opportunity for Source One Spares**.

Let me know if you want:
- The full part list, instructions, or downloads for schedule/terms
- Step-by-step recommendations to bid

Or I can keep going if you want only those opportunities that *allow alternate part numbers* or are even more “open”—just let me know your filter!

Here’s a **comprehensive eligibility and competition write-up**—using both the *details from solicitations* and the *AMC/AMSC code check via the NSN tab*—for the two most relevant “no source approval required” opportunities you screened from your HigherGov Saved Search:

## 1. POWER SUPPLY, ANTI (NSN 1680-01-628-6883)  
**Solicitation:** N0038325QH113  
**End Use:** P-8 Aircraft  
**Agency:** NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support  
**NAICS:** 336413 – Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment  
**Deadline:** August 15, 2025

### **NSN & Competition Profile**
- **NSN:** 1680-01-628-6883
- **AMC:** 2 — *Competitive item; no data or data for the evaluation of alternate offers available, uneconomical to convert for competition. Competition open to existing commercial sources.*
- **AMSC:** Z — *Commercial/off-the-shelf item; commercial manuals apply; no special engineering data necessary[1].*

### **Solicitation Key Points**
- Requires an FAA-Certified part with *FAA Form 8130-3 Airworthy Approval Tag* from a certified repair station or commercial supplier.
- **No SAR (Source Approval Request), QPL, or brand/OEM restriction**—as confirmed by both the AMC/AMSC and the text of the RFQ.
- Multiple suppliers are listed as “approved” but any commercial supplier with FAA airworthiness certification may quote.
- Evaluated on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  
- Ships to Navy; used for the interim support of the P-8 program.

### **Practical Eligibility**
- If you are a supplier or distributor of commercial aircraft electrical parts and can provide valid 8130-3 paperwork, you are eligible to bid and win—no SAR or artificial barrier.
- *This is a rare “true” open commercial aviation chance in the federal system for a spares company with surplused or aftermarket inventory, so long as it’s airworthy and properly certified.*

## 2. ACTUATOR, ELECTRO-MECHANICAL, LINE (NSN 1680-01-008-8834)  
**Solicitation:** FA811825R0032  
**Use:** E-3 AWACS Aircraft  
**Agency:** Air Force Sustainment Center  
**Set-Aside:** SBA  
**NAICS:** 336413  
**Deadline:** August 25, 2025

### **NSN & Competition Profile**
- **NSN:** 1680-01-008-8834
- **AMC:** 3 — *Item requires source approval/qualification. Data is NOT available for new vendors to quote as pure commercial. You must be approved via SAR or have prior qualification with the Air Force or Navy for this part.*
- **AMSC:** B — *There is engineering/technical/test data available, but you must be formally “qualified" as a supplier first (typically via SAR), based on evaluation of your test results, processes, or manufacturing ability.*

### **Solicitation Key Points**
- Depot overhaul/repair contract (IDIQ), multiple years, covering E-3 flight-critical components.
- Air Force and Navy both list item as requiring **source approval**—not open to new, unqualified vendors without a formal SAR process (though not all RFQs blatantly spell this out, AMC/AMSC codes confirm this).
- Typical candidates are the OEM, prior DLA/DoD-approved MROs, or anyone who has already passed SAR.
- Some technical data provided, but not enough for a non-qualified newcomer to quote and win directly.

### **Practical Eligibility**
- Only those who have successfully gone through SAR (or are the original manufacturer, or a previously qualified provider) are eligible to win.
- *A new commercial spares company—unless already on the approved vendor list for this NSN—would NOT be able to bid directly as prime.*

## **Bottom Line**

- **POWER SUPPLY, ANTI** is a *genuinely open opportunity* for new commercial sources with FAA airworthy certification.
- **ACTUATOR, ELECTRO-MECHANICAL** is **not open** to new, unqualified vendors due to SAR/qualification requirements, regardless of what text may imply—the AMC/AMSC codes are definitive.

**For your process:**  
- Always check the AMC/AMSC codes (via NSN tab) as a final gating screen on any “potentially open” aviation opportunity.  
- If AMC is 1, 3, or AMSC is B, G, or similar, SAR or special approval will be required.

Let me know if you want a comparable analysis for any other opportunities or a walk-through on SAR/qualification routes if that ever becomes a strategic consideration.

Here’s a **comprehensive eligibility, restriction, and code-based write-up** for three recent aircraft opportunities, using both the solicitation details and the **AMC/AMSC codes from the NSN tab** for definitive procurement status:

## 1. POWER SUPPLY, ANTI – P-8 Aircraft  
**Solicitation:** N0038325QH113  
**NSN:** 1680-01-628-6883  
- **AMC:** 2 (competitive, no new data buys planned)
- **AMSC:** Z (commercial/off-the-shelf item, no special data needed)

**Eligibility & Competition:**  
- *No source approval required.*  
- **Open to all suppliers**—just must provide an FAA 8130-3 Airworthy Approval Tag from a certified repair station or commercial supplier.  
- **No QPL, SAR, or OEM lock**. LPTA award process.
- *Summary:* This is a rare, truly open government buy for a P-8 part: commercial aviation dealers or MRO providers with airworthy surplus or repair capability can bid without SAR/OEM restriction[1].

## 2. E-3 ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ACTUATOR  
**Solicitation:** FA811825R0032  
**NSN:** 1680-01-008-8834  
- **Air Force AMC/AMSC:** 3B (SAR required—even if some tech data exists)  
- **Navy AMC/AMSC:** 3B

**Eligibility & Competition:**  
- **Source Approval/Qualification Required:**  
  - AMC 3, AMSC B is the classic “must go through qualification or already be a previously identified/approved source.”
  - If you are not already SAR-approved for this NSN/part, you cannot win direct award.  
  - *Summary:* A newcomer reseller or broker can’t bid without a SAR, even if the solicitation isn’t explicit; only established, previously qualified MROs or OEMs are eligible[2].

## 3. KC-46 ACTUATOR, ELECTRO-MECHANICAL, LINE  
**Solicitation:** FD20302502207  
**NSN:** 1680-01-653-3265  
- **AMC:** 3 (Air Force)  
- **AMSC:** D (source approval required, data may exist but qualification still mandatory)

**Eligibility & Competition:**  
- **Must be an approved source or complete the SAR process before award.**  
- Data may be available, but the part is source-controlled due to form, fit, function, or safety. Newcomers must clear additional hurdles—no “as is” surplus sales by default[3].

### **How to Use This in Your Work**
- **ALWAYS check the AMC and AMSC codes in the NSN tab** before considering a “potentially open” aviation buy.
- **For fully open sales:** Look for AMC codes 0, 2, 4, or 5 and AMSC codes Z or 1.
- **For SAR or tight restrictions:** AMC 3, 1 and AMSC B, G, D, or “PEC” mean you’re facing either exclusive buys or a lengthy source approval process.

**Summary:**  
- The P-8 Power Supply opportunity is **fully open** (no SAR/OEM block).
- E-3 Actuator and KC-46 Actuator **require SAR/qualification**—not open for new, unapproved sources.
- *The AMC/AMSC code is definitive, more than the body text—ALWAYS check it.*

Ready to screen the next one. Let me know if you want this repeated for future listings, or if you want to filter for codes only indicating truly unrestricted competition.

### **P-8A Valve Assembly, Environmental Control System (ECS Valve)**

**Solicitation**: [SPRPA125QEM09](https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/valve-ecs-sprpa125qem09-o-ef5a3/)

**Agency**: DLA Aviation  
**Response Deadline**: August 11, 2025  
**DoD Standard Price**: $34,482.00  

#### **AMC/AMSC CODES (from NSN tab)**
- **AMC: 1C**  
  - *AMC 1*: “Suitable for competitive acquisition for the first time.”
  - *C*: “Data is not available or adequate for full competition. Controlled by the OEM and usually sole or limited source. Only sources who have the required data from OEM, or are qualified, may bid.”
- **AMSC: PEC**  
  - “Part requires engineering change or is a safety/public health critical application item (CAI).” Usually means OEM involvement, or at minimum, engineering approval is needed.

#### **Eligibility & Restrictions**
- **Critical Application Item:** This part is flight-critical for the P-8A Poseidon.
- **Certification/Traceability:** Can only be procured from suppliers who provide FAA-Certified parts with an FAA Form 8130-3 Airworthy Approval Tag.
- **Competition Level:** While it’s listed as “open” under emergency acquisition rules, the **AMC/AMSC codes show this is a de facto restricted or sole/limited source buy**.
- **Typical Situation:** Unless you are already working directly with the OEM (Meggitt North Hollywood, CAGE 79318) or are listed as an active FAA repair station with proven supply and traceability, you won’t be able to win as a new, non-approved source.

**AMC/AMSC Codes (from NSN Tab):**  
- **AMC:** 1 (Suitable for competitive acquisition for the first time—but generally means “open competition among approved sources” or “requires SAR to become approved”)

**Eligibility & Restrictions:**  
- **Primary Approved Sources:** Boeing and a shortlist of major OEM/legacy suppliers (full list in solicitation).
- **New sources:**  
  - *You must complete a SAR (Source Approval Request) to be approved.*
