Continuing from your last batch, I've worked through the next set of HigherGov results (skipping those already assessed), applying the strict SOS NSN/AMC/AMSC eligibility filter and then conducting a full SOS checklist on each new eligible opportunity.

**Here’s your status update:**

## ELIGIBLE OPPORTUNITIES — FULL SOS ASSESSMENT

**1. SPE4A625RXD41 – NSN 4920015900962 – Radiometer, Photomet**
- **AMC:** 3Z | **AMSC:** Z → *Eligible* for filter.
- **Go/No-Go:** **NO-GO** — HUBZone-only set aside (not actionable for general competition).
- **Notes:** Strong commercial demand, recent awards, but restricted to HUBZone businesses only[1][2].

**2. SPE4A625Q1449 – NSN 6605009655414 – Servo, Indicator**
- **AMC:** 3Q | **AMSC:** Z → *Eligible* for filter.
- **Go/No-Go:** **NO-GO** — Opportunity deadline has expired (as of July 17, 2025).
- **Notes:** Would otherwise be a sizable, highly competitive opportunity at $600K+—but not actionable due to timing[3].

## SUMMARY: OPPORTUNITY STATUS

- **Previously Assessed & Recommended “GO”:**
    - SPE4A525R0258 – NSN 1560016981190 (Stiffener, Aircraft)[4]
    - SPE4A525R0256 – NSN 1560016981184 (Stiffener, Aircraft)[5]
    - SPE4A525R0253 – NSN 1560009864065 (Plate and Spring AS)[1]
- **Previously or newly processed with “NO-GO”:**
    - SPE4A625RXD41 – NSN 4920015900962 (Radiometer/Photomet) — HUBZone only[2]
    - SPE4A625Q1449 – NSN 6605009655414 (Servo, Indicator) — Expired[3]

**All other listed/visible results either do not meet strict SOS eligibility criteria or were previously screened—skipped silently per your instructions.**

### Next Steps
- Want to continue with the next batch of 5 for filter/screening and full checklist?
- Would you like a summary for only actionables, or a detailed audit log of “NO-GO” determinations for training/reference?

Let me know if you want this process to keep running in sequential batches, or if you wish to pause, adjust criteria, or request deeper write-ups on any of the “GO” results.
