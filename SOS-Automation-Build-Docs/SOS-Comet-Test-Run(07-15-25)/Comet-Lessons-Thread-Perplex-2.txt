Here’s the most effective way to **prompt me for this kind of aviation opportunity screening and eligibility filtering**—so you get **just actionable, relevant results** (real-world, DLA/DoD, open-market NSNs you can actually pursue):

## **Best-Practice Prompt for Source-Approval Screening**

**Prompt Template:**

> “Screen this HigherGov search/results for ONLY those opportunities where:  
> - The NSN’s AMSC code is Z, G, or H (i.e., truly open commercial/competitive, no source approval or SAR required),  
> - AND the AMC code is 1, 2, 4, or 5 (i.e., competitive or partial competitive—NOT sole or restricted),
> - AND there is no SAR, source approval, traceability, QPL, or OEM restriction based on the NSN tab and official code definitions.
>
> For each opportunity:
> - Ignore/delete/skip any where AMSC is B, C, D, or G, or where any source approval/traceability is required, regardless of the AMC value or how the synopsis sounds.
> - Just give me:  
>   - The NSN  
>   - The part name  
>   - The solicitation title and deadline  
>   - Direct links to the solicitation and to the NSN code page  
>   - A one-sentence eligibility summary (ex: ‘OPEN/COMPETITIVE for all; no source approval, no trace required’)
>
> Do NOT include or describe any opportunity that has *any* source-approval restriction or noncommercial gate, even if the solicitation body is confusing or contradictory.
>
> If there are zero such items, report ‘none found—no true open-market opportunities in this batch’ and stop.  
> Otherwise, repeat this process.

### **Why This Works**
- **You get ONLY eligible, open-market, real commercial parts—no C-coded, B-coded, or SAR-locked junk.**
- All the “code lawyering” is handled upfront as part of the filter—so you don’t see “not actionable” stuff.
- Direct links + minimal summary = you can verify and pursue without wading through noise.

### **Additional Tips**
- If your search batch has hundreds of NSNs, consider:  
  - “Review only the first X results for speed, or flag just the ones that match AMSC Z/G/H and AMC 1/2/4/5.”
- For uncommon ‘G’ or ‘H’ AMSC codes, be explicit: “Explain if G or H is not a true open commercial situation.”
- Want to filter for “allows FAA Form 8130-3 surplus,” but not OEM-only? Add:  
  - “Include only if explicit airworthy surplus is accepted and no brand or proprietary restriction applies.”

### **Sample Super-Short Prompt**

> “Show me only those NSNs/opportunities in my HigherGov search where:
> - AMSC is Z, G, or H
> - AMC is 1, 2, 4, or 5
> - No source approval, SAR, or traceability is required (per the NSN code page)
> Give a hotlist of direct links + one-line eligibility—skip everything else.”

**Using this prompt, you’ll never see time-wasting “not eligible” parts, and I’ll give you exactly the actionable deal flow you need.**
