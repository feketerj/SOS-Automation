Great question—and you’re not alone! The best way to get a capable AI assistant (like me) to **start at a specific page, systematically process your work, and still “act human”—with good pacing, updates, reasoning, and context awareness—while working through task batches** is to:

## 1. **Explicitly Tell Me Where to Start and What to Sequence**
> Start on [this exact URL or search or tab]: __  
> Work through each result/opportunity/section, one-by-one.
> For each item: [Your customized task here, e.g., “filter NSNs on this search, check AMC/AMSC, only show eligible, open-market parts, skip rest, link out and summarize in a concise but human format.”]
> After each, pause for me to summarize, clarify, or let you interject, then I’ll keep going. Make it conversational if needed.
> If you want a batch/digest summary after N items or want to pause/ask questions, just say so.

## 2. **Prompt for "Chunking," Not Just Autopilot**
- Humans like to see what’s happening mid-process, not just wait for a wall of text.  
**Best prompt:**
> After every X items (say 3–5), pause, give me a summary (“Here are the open opportunities so far, here’s what I filtered”), and ask if I should proceed.

## 3. **Explicitly Ask for “Talk to Me Like a Human, Not a Bot”**
- Instruct:  
> Give action summaries, mention if you see “dead ends” or time-wasters, say why something was filtered.
> Add brief rationale (e.g., “This NSN is a dead end because it’s source-controlled per the code—skipping per your preference”).
> You can interleave explanations as if explaining to a project teammate:  
  “Here’s what I did, here’s why, here’s what’s next, want me to adjust?”

## 4. **Set Micro-Interactivity**
> At each natural breakpoint (10 results, page or section, etc.): “Pause and check for my input—even just a quick 'OK, keep going.'”
> If you want less interactivity, say, “Just alert me after you find something actually eligible or after 20 results.”

## 5. **Sample Full Prompt (Best Practice)**
> Start at [insert exact URL or page], and for each opportunity/NSN/result, do:
> - Check codes (AMC/AMSC or however you want filtered).
> - If truly actionable, return: link, one-line summary, short eligibility note; be concise, human, conversational.
> - If not, skip silently unless it’s a common confusion point, in which case briefly say why it’s skipped (like training a new analyst).
> - After X items, give a quick summary and “should I keep going?” prompt.
> - “Act like a senior analyst briefing another person—explain, but don’t lecture.”
> - Stop and hand off any time I ask, or if you spot ambiguity.

## 6. **Human Touch Tips**
- Use natural transitions:  
  “Alright, that’s the first 5—so far only one is open, the rest are SAR-locked. Want to drill further, or change filters?”
- When hitting a rule-based dead end, say:  
  “I’m hitting the same source approval wall here—do you want to widen the filter or focus on a different search?”
- Recognize fatigue:  
  “If you’re good with this batch, I can switch gears or summarize all key findings for you.”

### **Key Takeaway**

**Tell me what “done” looks like, how interactive to be (“act human, check in, not just drone on”), where to start, and how often to pause for direction.**  
If folks get nervous because I’m too “agent-like” and not enough conversational or I’m moving too quickly, just instruct:  
> “Be explicit, check in every X, explain as you go, and don’t run away with full autonomy.”

This balances efficiency, auditability, and makes the process feel “right” to both you and any observer in the room.

If you want an exact kickoff, just feed me:
> Start screening on this [link], one-by-one, pause to check in after each 5, act like you’re working with me at the next desk and talk through your thinking—proceed until I say stop.
