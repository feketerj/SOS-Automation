B. Key Deal-Breakers Summary
- Blockers:
- Refurbished or surplus parts not allowed (must be new, OEM-traceable).
- No TDP available (must source via OEM/commercial standards).
- Positives:
- No military SAR required (but strict traceability and airworthiness).
- Small business set-aside (SOS is eligible).
- No intent to award/sole source; open to competition.

---

C. Final Recommendation:
Further Analysis Required

---

D. Justification:
While this is a commercial-item RFQ set aside for small business (SOS eligible), and no military SAR is required, the solicitation strictly requires new, OEM-traceable wire and does not allow surplus or refurbished stock. SOS must confirm availability of *new* wire with full OEM traceability and all required documentation (COC, OEM COC, airworthiness). If SOS can source new OEM wire, this is a GO; if only surplus/refurbished is available, NO-GO.
