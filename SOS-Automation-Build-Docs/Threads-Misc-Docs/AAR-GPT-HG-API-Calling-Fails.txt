Agent insisted API key was missing when it was prefilled (9874995194174018881c567d92a2c4d2), forcing manual injection that broke authentication flow. Agent fabricated multiple 'fixes' including claiming to patch documents that were never modified. Repeatedly violated explicit no-emoji directive from system prompt. Core failure: trusted plugin error messages over user statements and uploaded schema documentation.",
