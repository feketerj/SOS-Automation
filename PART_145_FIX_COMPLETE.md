# Part 145 Repair Station Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem Statement
Navy solicitations mentioning "any FAA Part 145 shop capable of producing 8130-3" were incorrectly marked as NO-GO because the system treated Part 145 as an "approved source" restriction.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Part 145 Detection Patterns
**Location:** `regex_pack_v419_complete.yaml` lines 90-102
- Added patterns to detect FAA Part 145 repair stations
- Set negative scoring weight (-90) to mark as positive indicator
- Patterns cover various phrasings:
  - "any FAA Part 145 certified"
  - "FAA Part 145 repair station"
  - "Part 145 shop capable"

### 2. Added Part 145 Exception Logic
**Location:** `sos_ingestion_gate_v419.py` lines 427-440
- Checks for Part 145 language before approved source evaluation
- When detected, marks as GO-eligible through MRO network
- Prevents false NO-GO from approved source logic

### 3. Fixed FAA 8130 Contact CO Preservation
**Location:** `sos_ingestion_gate_v419.py` lines 839-842
- Added check to preserve FURTHER_ANALYSIS decision when Contact CO is set
- Prevents civilian platform detection from overriding Contact CO cases
- Ensures "approved sources + FAA 8130" correctly triggers Contact CO

## Test Results
All 5 test scenarios passing:
1. **Part 145 capable of 8130-3** → GO ✓
2. **Any FAA certified repair station** → GO ✓
3. **Part 145 MRO** → GO ✓
4. **Traditional approved source (QPL/OEM)** → NO-GO ✓
5. **Approved sources WITH FAA 8130** → FURTHER_ANALYSIS (Contact CO) ✓

## Business Impact
- Navy solicitations with Part 145 language now correctly identified as GO
- SOS can bid through their Part 145 MRO network
- No more false NO-GOs for legitimate opportunities
- Contact CO logic properly triggers for ambiguous cases

## Files Modified
1. `regex_pack_v419_complete.yaml` - Added Part 145 patterns
2. `sos_ingestion_gate_v419.py` - Added exception logic and fixed Contact CO preservation
3. `test_part_145_logic.py` - Created comprehensive test suite

## Status
✓ Implementation complete
✓ All tests passing
✓ Ready for production
