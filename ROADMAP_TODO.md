---

## PHASE 4: ADDITIONAL AGENT INTEGRATION
**Goal:** Improve accuracy and add specialized capabilities

### Potential New Agents
- [ ] **Verification Agent** - Double-checks GO decisions
- [ ] **Summarization Agent** - Creates executive summaries
- [ ] **Compliance Agent** - Checks regulatory requirements
- [ ] **Pricing Agent** - Estimates opportunity value
- [ ] **Risk Assessment Agent** - Evaluates risk factors

### Agent Pipeline Enhancement
```
Current: Regex → Batch → Agent
Future:  Regex → Batch → Agent → Verification → Specialist Agents
```

### Implementation Considerations
- Cost/benefit analysis for each agent
- Parallel vs sequential processing
- Conditional agent activation
- Agent disagreement resolution
- Performance impact assessment

---

## PHASE 5: AUTOMATION SETUP
**Goal:** Fully automated pipeline execution

- [ ] Error notification system

### Trigger-Based Automation
- [ ] New opportunity triggers
- [ ] Threshold-based alerts (e.g., >10 GOs)
- [ ] Agency-specific monitoring
- [ ] Keyword/category watchers
- [ ] Budget threshold notifications

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Windows Task Scheduler integration
- [ ] Cloud deployment option (AWS/Azure)
- [ ] Queue management system
- [ ] Retry logic for failures
- [ ] Resource scaling capabilities

---

## PHASE 6: EMAIL & NOTIFICATION OUTPUTS
**Goal:** Proactive communication of results

### Email Features
- [ ] Automated result summaries
- [ ] GO opportunity alerts
- [ ] Daily/weekly digest emails

## PHASE 7: ZAPIER INTEGRATION
**Goal:** Connect to 5000+ apps via Zapier

### Zapier Triggers (From SOS)
- [ ] New assessment complete
- [ ] GO opportunity found
- [ ] Batch job finished
- [ ] Error occurred
- [ ] Threshold exceeded

### Zapier Actions (To SOS)
- [ ] Add endpoint to queue
- [ ] Run assessment
- [ ] Generate report
- [ ] Export results
- [ ] Update configuration

### Integration Points
```python
# Webhook endpoints needed
POST /api/assessments/trigger
GET  /api/assessments/{id}/status
GET  /api/assessments/{id}/results
POST /api/endpoints/add
```
