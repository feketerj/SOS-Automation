# TODO CODEX - SOS Assessment Automation Tool
**Created:** September 13, 2025
**Status:** Pipeline Operational - Optimization & Cleanup Phase
**Core Principle:** Do No Harm - All changes must preserve existing functionality

## üìã CODEX EXECUTION GUIDELINES

<execution_principles>
### Primary Directive
**#1 Priority: Never break the working application**
- Test all changes in isolation first
- Maintain rollback capability for every change
- Validate functionality after each modification
- Use high reasoning effort for all coding tasks
</execution_principles>

<task_approach>
### How to Execute Tasks
1. **Use Structured Thinking:** Each task includes XML tags for clarity
2. **Work Incrementally:** Tasks are broken into small, validated steps
3. **Observe Progress:** Add print statements and logging for debugging
4. **Stay Within Limits:** Each module has a tool budget to prevent overthinking
5. **Allow Self-Reflection:** Validation checkpoints included for quality assurance
</task_approach>

<communication_style>
### Task Language Guidelines
- Tasks use suggestive language ("Consider...", "It would be helpful to...")
- Avoid overly firm commands that might cause overengineering
- Each complex task is split into 3-5 smaller subtasks
- Flexibility is built in to allow for optimal solutions
</communication_style>

## üìù Notes for Successful Execution

<error_handling_mindset>
### Approach to Errors
- **Errors are expected** - Even with careful planning, issues will arise
- **Iterate without frustration** - Each error is a learning opportunity
- **Keep refining** - Adjust approach based on what works
- **Document failures** - Track what didn't work to avoid repetition
- **Celebrate progress** - Focus on incremental improvements
</error_handling_mindset>

<execution_reminders>
### Key Reminders
- Each module can be worked on independently
- Priorities can be adjusted based on business needs
- All changes must pass regression testing
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Security must be considered in all changes
- **Use XML tags** when communicating complex requirements
- **Break large tasks** into 3-5 smaller validated steps
- **Add observability** with print statements and logging
- **Stay within tool budgets** to prevent overthinking
- **Test incrementally** to catch issues early
