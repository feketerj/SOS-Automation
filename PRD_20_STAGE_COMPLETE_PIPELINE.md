# Product Requirements Document: Complete 20-Stage SOS Pipeline Architecture

## Executive Summary

Full implementation of ALL 20 knockout criteria as individual stages, each with paired Batch/Agent processors. Every criterion gets dedicated assessment ensuring nothing is missed.

## Complete Stage Mapping (All 20 Criteria)

### Stage Architecture
Each criterion from the SOS logic gets its own dedicated stage:

1. **TIMING** - Deadline and expiration checks
2. **DOMAIN** - Aviation vs non-aviation/weapons
3. **SECURITY & CLEARANCE** - Classification requirements
4. **SET-ASIDES** - 8(a), SDVOSB, WOSB, HUBZone
5. **SOURCE RESTRICTIONS** - OEM, sole source, QPL
6. **TECHNICAL DATA** - Drawings and data rights
7. **EXPORT CONTROL** - Export restrictions
8. **AMC/AMSC CODES** - Acquisition method codes
9. **SAR** - Source approval requirements
10. **PLATFORM/ENGINE/DRONE** - Military vs commercial
11. **PROCUREMENT RESTRICTIONS** - Manufacturing requirements
12. **COMPETITION STATUS** - Incumbent advantages
13. **SUBCONTRACTING PROHIBITED** - Prime performance requirements
14. **CONTRACT VEHICLE** - IDIQ, GWAC, GSA requirements
15. **NON-STANDARD ACQUISITION** - OTA, SBIR, BAA
16. **IT SYSTEM ACCESS** - JEDMICS, ETIMS, cFolders
17. **UNIQUE CERTIFICATIONS** - Agency-specific certs
18. **MAINTENANCE/WARRANTY** - Direct support obligations
19. **CAD/CAM FORMAT** - Native file requirements
20. **SCOPE** - Organizational capability match

## Optimized Stage Order (Easy â†’ Hard)

### Binary/Simple (Stages 1-7)
These are text-match or simple lookups:
1. **TIMING** - Date comparison
2. **SET-ASIDES** - Exact text match
3. **SECURITY & CLEARANCE** - Keyword search
4. **NON-STANDARD ACQUISITION** - Type identification
5. **CONTRACT VEHICLE** - Vehicle requirements
6. **EXPORT CONTROL** - Export restrictions
7. **AMC/AMSC CODES** - Code lookup

### Technical/Specific (Stages 8-14)
These require understanding context:
8. **SOURCE RESTRICTIONS** - OEM/QPL analysis
9. **SAR** - Source approval evaluation
10. **PLATFORM/ENGINE/DRONE** - Platform identification
11. **DOMAIN** - Aviation classification
12. **TECHNICAL DATA** - Data rights assessment
13. **IT SYSTEM ACCESS** - System requirements
14. **UNIQUE CERTIFICATIONS** - Certification needs

### Business/Nuanced (Stages 15-20)
These require judgment and inference:
15. **SUBCONTRACTING PROHIBITED** - Performance requirements
16. **PROCUREMENT RESTRICTIONS** - Manufacturing feasibility
17. **COMPETITION STATUS** - Competitive landscape
18. **MAINTENANCE/WARRANTY** - Support obligations
19. **CAD/CAM FORMAT** - Technical format needs
20. **SCOPE** - Capability assessment

## Individual Stage Prompts (Under 3K tokens each for focus)

### Stage 1: TIMING Assessment
```markdown
# TIMING Check Agent

## Pipeline Context
You are Stage 1 of 20. You ONLY check if the opportunity has expired.

## Implementation Notes

### Token Counts Per Stage
- Each stage prompt: 2,000-3,000 tokens
- Context passed: 500-1,000 tokens
- Document: 2,000-3,000 tokens
- Total per stage: ~5,000-6,000 tokens

### Cost Analysis (500/year)
- 20 batch stages Ã— 5K tokens = 100K tokens @ $1/1M = $0.10
- 20 agent QC Ã— 3K tokens = 60K tokens @ $2/1M = $0.12
- Average early termination at stage 5 = 75% cost savings
- Effective cost: ~$0.05 per opportunity
- Annual: 500 Ã— $0.05 = $25/year

### Benefits of 20 Stages
1. **Nothing missed** - Every criterion gets dedicated attention
2. **Laser focus** - Each stage does ONE thing perfectly
3. **Clear debugging** - Know exactly which stage/criterion failed
4. **Progressive context** - Each stage builds on previous
5. **Early termination** - Most fail in first 5 stages (cheap)
6. **High confidence** - Specialized = accurate

This is the complete mapping - all 20 criteria as individual stages!
