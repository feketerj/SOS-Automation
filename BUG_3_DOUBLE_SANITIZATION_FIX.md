# Bug #3: Double Sanitization Fix

## Date: September 13, 2025
## Status: COMPLETE ✓

## Problem Description
Data was being sanitized twice in the pipeline, potentially overwriting correctly formatted fields with incorrect values. This occurred in FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py where:
1. Line 493: First sanitization after batch processing
2. Lines 802-840: Manual field formatting (potentially corrupting sanitized data)
3. Line 843: Second sanitization after manual formatting

## Root Cause
- No tracking mechanism to identify already-sanitized data
- Manual field formatting between sanitizations could overwrite correct values
- Second sanitization would re-process already clean data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Sanitization Tracking
**File:** `decision_sanitizer.py`
- Added `_sanitized` marker to track processed data
- Created `is_already_sanitized()` method to check status
- Modified `sanitize()` to skip already-processed data

```python
def is_already_sanitized(data):
    """Check if data has already been sanitized"""
    unified_markers = ['_sanitized', 'pipeline_stage', 'assessment_type']
    has_markers = all(key in data for key in unified_markers)
    has_normalized_result = data.get('result') in ['GO', 'NO-GO', 'INDETERMINATE']
    return has_markers and has_normalized_result

def sanitize(data):
    """Transform data to unified Agent schema format"""
    # Skip if already sanitized to prevent double processing
    if DecisionSanitizer.is_already_sanitized(data):
        return data
    # ... continue with sanitization
```

### 2. Updated Batch Processor
**File:** `Mistral_Batch_Processor/FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py`
- Modified lines 800-843 to check for sanitization marker
- Preserves already-sanitized data instead of reformatting
- Only formats unsanitized data

```python
# Check if already sanitized
if result.get('_sanitized'):
    # Already sanitized, just add verification fields
    sanitized_result = result.copy()
    sanitized_result['verification_method'] = result.get('verification_method', 'NONE')
    sanitized_result['disagreement'] = result.get('disagreement', False)
    formatted_verified_results.append(sanitized_result)
else:
    # Not sanitized yet, format manually
    # ... existing formatting code
```

### 3. Fixed URL Field Mapping
- Added missing fallback: `source_path` → `sam_url`
- Added missing fallback: `path` → `hg_url`
- Preserves direct fields when present

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. **test_double_sanitization_fix.py**
   - Verifies sanitization marker works
   - Tests that re-sanitization is skipped
   - Validates batch processing with mixed data

2. **test_sanitization_data_integrity.py**
   - Confirms all fields preserved correctly
   - Tests priority fallback for multi-source fields
   - Verifies no data corruption on re-sanitization

### Test Results
✓ Already-sanitized data detected and preserved
✓ _sanitized marker prevents re-processing
✓ Batch sanitization handles mixed data correctly
✓ All critical fields preserved during sanitization
✓ Priority fallback working for URL fields
✓ No data corruption on re-sanitization

## Impact
- **Performance:** Slight improvement by skipping unnecessary re-processing
- **Data Quality:** Prevents field corruption from double processing
- **Backward Compatibility:** Fully maintained, handles both sanitized and unsanitized data

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Changes:** Additive only (marker field added)
- **Rollback:** Remove `_sanitized` checks in decision_sanitizer.py

## Files Modified
1. **decision_sanitizer.py**
   - Added `is_already_sanitized()` method
   - Added `_sanitized` marker to output
   - Fixed URL field fallback chain

2. **Mistral_Batch_Processor/FULL_BATCH_PROCESSOR.py**
   - Added check for `_sanitized` marker
   - Conditional formatting based on sanitization status

## Files Created
1. **test_double_sanitization_fix.py** - Tests sanitization prevention
2. **test_sanitization_data_integrity.py** - Tests data preservation
3. **BUG_3_DOUBLE_SANITIZATION_FIX.md** - This documentation

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test double sanitization prevention
python test_double_sanitization_fix.py

# Test data integrity
python test_sanitization_data_integrity.py

# Run full validation suite
python quality_control_validator.py
```

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases where `_sanitized` marker might be lost
- Consider removing manual formatting code in future refactor
- Track performance improvement metrics
