THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.  NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE.  ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS NOTICE IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

INTRODUCTION

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a solicitation, negotiate and award a contract action to CFM International (CFM), located in West Chester, Ohio, on an other than full and open competition basis, for the procurement of an approximate quantity range of two (2) to seven (7) new CFM56-7B27AE core engines and associated equipment (e.g., engine covers, engine stand and cradle sets, etc.) for P-8A Poseidon aircraft and approximately one (1) new CFM56-7B24E core engine and associated equipment (e.g., debris monitoring system kit, engine cover, engine stand and cradle set, etc.) for C-40 Clipper aircraft.  Contract action award is planned to occur during either the fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 or the first quarter of FY 2026.  Delivery of the first engine (and associated items) shall be within one (1) year after the contract action with delivery of each subsequent engine (and associated items) within three (3) month intervals.

ELIGIBILITY

The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement is 2840 and the NAICS code is 336412.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND

CFM International (CFM), West Chester, OH is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The CFM56-7B27AE and CFM56-7B24E engines meet all requirements set forth by the NAVAIR Airworthiness Authority and are essential for maintaining configuration consistency throughout the P-8 and C-40 aircraft fleets.  As the OEM, CFM is the only company that possesses the complete set of technical data for those engines.

REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

Within the duration of the contract action, which is planned to begin either in the fourth quarter of Government FY 2025 or the first quarter of FY 2026, the contractor shall manufacture and deliver new core engines.  Since the Government does not possess sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, any contractor (other than CFM) must either team/partner with CFM or obtain a license from CFM for the technical data.  The contractor shall provide the facilities, equipment, material, technical data, and qualified personnel to accomplish the manufacture and delivery of the core engines.

In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.  Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business&rsquo; General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost.  The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14.  If the prime is a joint venture, the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

Interested persons (respondents), other than CFM, must submit an UNCLASSIFIED capability statement.

Each capability statement shall include/address at a minimum:

(1) Small/Large Business Status:  A company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), SAM.gov Unique Entity ID, CAGE Code, and a statement regarding current small/large business status.  Respondents to this notice must indicate whether they qualify as a Small, Small Disadvantaged, Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-Owned, 8(a), Hub Zone or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern.  If claiming small business status, provide an explanation of your company&#39;s ability to perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.

(2) Business:  Due to the fact that CFM is the only entity with sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, each interested party (other than CFM) must include either (1) a teaming agreement (or equivalent document) signed by CFM indicating agreement to partner with or be a subcontractor to the interested party for the contemplated procurement; or (2) a document signed by CFM indicating agreement to offer a license to the interested party for the technical data.

(3) Execution:  A description of the technical approach for commencing the effort at the estimated award date of either fourth quarter of Government FY 2025 or the first quarter of FY 2026.

(4) Experience:  A description of previous (awarded within last 3 years) or current relevant contracts.

(5) Facilities and Equipment:  Availability and description of facilities and equipment that will be utilized to meet requirements.

(6) Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the Capability Statement.

Data Markings.

Any responses marked in a manner that will not permit such review may be returned without being assessed or considered.  All submissions must include a statement which clearly allows for the information to be disclosed with covered Government support contractors.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a solicitation, negotiate and award a contract to CFM International (CFM), located in Ohio, on an other than full and open competition basis, for the procurement of approximately twenty four (24) new CFM56-7B27AE core engines and associated equipment (e.g., engine covers, engine stand and cradle sets, etc.) for P-8A Poseidon aircraft and approximately four (4) new CFM56-7B24E core engines and associated equipment (e.g., debris monitoring system kits, engine covers, engine stand and cradle sets, etc.) for C-40 Clipper aircraft via a class of contract actions occurring within the Government Fiscal years 2025 through 2028.



ELIGIBILITY



The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement is 2840 and the NAICS code is 336412.



PROGRAM BACKGROUND



CFM International (CFM), Cincinnati, OH is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The CFM56-7B27AE engine meets all requirements set forth by the NAVAIR Airworthiness Authority and are essential for maintaining configuration consistency throughout the P-8 aircraft fleet.  Likewise, the CFM56-7B24E engines meet all requirements set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration and are essential for maintaining configuration consistency throughout the C-40 aircraft fleets.  As the OEM, CFM is the only company that possesses the complete set of technical data for those engines.



REQUIRED CAPABILITIES



As previously stated, the class of contract actions are planned to occur within the FY2025 through FY2028 timeframe.  The contractor shall deliver new CFM56-7B27AE and CFM56-7B24E core engines and associated equipment.  The following depicts the estimated maximum quantity by year of each engine type that NAVAIR intends to procure.

Engine Type              FY25 Qty   FY26 Qty  FY27 Qty  FY28 Qty  Total Qty

CFM56-7B27AE            5                 8                 7                  4                 24

CFM56-7B24E               1                 1                 1                  1                   4

Total                                6                 9                 8                  5                 28





For each contract action, deliveries shall be one engine at a time with the first engine delivered within 1 year after contract action execution and subsequent engines delivered one at a time at 3 month intervals.  The contractor shall either be a CFM-certified new engine dealer or have the capability to manufacture new CFM56-7B27AE core engines and associated equipment (e.g., engine covers, engine stand and cradle sets, etc.) and new CFM56-7B24E and associated equipment (e.g., debris monitoring system kits, engine covers, engine stand and cradle sets, etc.).  If the contractor&rsquo;s approach is to manufacture the engines, since the Government does not possess sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to manufacture new CFM56-7B27AE and CFM56-7B24E core engines, any contractor (other than CFM) must either team/partner with CFM or obtain a license from CFM for the technical data.

In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.  Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business&rsquo; General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost.  The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14.  If the prime is a joint venture, the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

Interested persons (respondents), other than CFM, must submit an UNCLASSIFIED capability statement.

Each capability statement shall include/address at a minimum:

(1) Small/Large Business Status:  A company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), DUNS Number, SAM Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), CAGE Code, and a statement regarding current small/large business status.

If claiming small business status, provide an explanation of your company&#39;s ability to perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.

(2) Business:

(a) If the interested party&rsquo;s approach is to deliver the engines as a CFM-certified new engine dealer, the capability statement must demonstrate that the interested party currently possesses such a certification or, in the alternative, may submit a letter of intent signed by CFM indicating that CFM intends to confer such a certification on the interested party within a timeframe that will enable the interested party to timely fulfill NAVAIR&rsquo;s delivery requirements as described in the Required Capabilities section above.

(b) If the interested party&rsquo;s approach is to manufacture the engines, due to the fact that CFM is the only entity with sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, the interested party must demonstrate that it currently possesses or has authorized access to the necessary technical data, or has a viable plan to obtain, generate, or otherwise secure authorized access to the necessary technical data, and that it will be maintained throughout the duration of the effort.

INTRODUCTION



The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a solicitation, negotiate and award a contract to CFM International (CFM), located in Ohio, on an other than full and open competition basis, for the procurement of approximately four (4) to eight (8) new CFM56-7B27AE core engines for P-8A Poseidon.



Initial contract award is planned to occur during either fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 or first quarter of FY 2025.  





ELIGIBILITY



The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement is 2840 and the NAICS code is 336412.



PROGRAM BACKGROUND



CFM International (CFM), Cincinnati, OH is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The CFM56-7B27AE engine meets all requirements set forth by the NAVAIR Airworthiness Authority and are essential for maintaining configuration consistency throughout the P-8 aircraft fleet.  As the OEM, CFM is the only company that possesses the complete set of technical data for this engine.



REQUIRED CAPABILITIES



Within the duration of the contract, which is planned to begin either in the fourth quarter of Government FY 2024 or the first quarter of FY 2025, the contractor shall deliver new CFM56-7B27AE core engines. The first engine must be delivered within 12 months of contract award and the other engines delivered at a pace of one per month thereafter.  The contractor shall either be a CFM-certified new engine dealer or have the capability to manufacture new CFM56-7B27AE core engines.  If the contractor&rsquo;s approach is to manufacture the engines, since the Government does not possess sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to manufacture new CFM56-7B27AE core engines, any contractor (other than CFM) must either team/partner with CFM or obtain a license from CFM for the technical data.

In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.  Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business&rsquo; General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost.  The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14.  If the prime is a joint venture, the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.



SUBMISSION DETAILS



Interested persons (respondents), other than CFM, must submit an UNCLASSIFIED capability statement.



Each capability statement shall include/address at a minimum:



(1) Small/Large Business Status:  A company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), DUNS Number, SAM Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), CAGE Code, and a statement regarding current small/large business status.  Respondents to this notice must indicate whether they qualify as a Small, Small Disadvantaged, Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-Owned, 8(a), Hub Zone or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern.  If claiming small business status, provide an explanation of your company&#39;s ability to perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.

(2) Business:

(a) If the interested party&rsquo;s approach is to deliver the engines as a CFM-certified new engine dealer, the capability statement must demonstrate that the interested party currently possesses such a certification or, in the alternative, may submit a letter of intent signed by CFM indicating that CFM intends to confer such a certification on the interested party within a timeframe that will enable the interested party to timely fulfill NAVAIR&rsquo;s delivery requirements as described in the Required Capabilities section above.

(b) If the interested party&rsquo;s approach is to manufacture the engines, due to the fact that CFM is the only entity with sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, the interested party must demonstrate that it currently possesses or has authorized access to the necessary technical data, or has a viable plan to obtain, generate, or otherwise secure authorized access to the necessary technical data, and that it will be maintained throughout the duration of the effort.

(3) Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the Capability Statement.



Data Markings.  In order to complete its review, NAVAIR must be able to share a respondent&rsquo;s information both within the Government and with covered Government support contractors as defined in DFARS clause 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data&mdash;Noncommercial Items (FEB 2014).  Any responses marked in a manner that will not permit such review may be returned without being assessed or considered.  All submissions must include a statement which clearly allows for the information to be disclosed with covered Government support contractors.

INTRODUCTION



The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is seeking sources as it intends to procure approximately four (4) to eight (8) new CFM56-7B27AE core engines for P-8A Poseidon aircraft during either fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 or first quarter of FY 2025.  This announcement constitutes a sources sought.



THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine potential and eligible businesses capable of providing the supplies described herein prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Notice.



ELIGIBILITY



The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement is 2840 and the NAICS code is 336412.



PROGRAM BACKGROUND



CFM International (CFM), Cincinnati, OH is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The CFM56-7B27AE engines meet all requirements set forth by the NAVAIR Airworthiness Authority and are essential for maintaining configuration consistency throughout the P-8 aircraft fleets.  As the OEM, CFM is the only company that possesses the complete set of technical data for those engines.



REQUIRED CAPABILITIES



Within the duration of the contract action, which is planned to begin either in the fourth quarter of Government FY 2024 or the first quarter of FY 2025, the contractor shall deliver new CFM56-7B27AE core engines.  The first engine must be delivered within 12 months of contract award and the other engines delivered at a pace of one per month thereafter.  The contractor shall either be a CFM-certified new engine dealer or have the capability to manufacture new CFM56-7B27AE core engines.  If the contractor&rsquo;s approach is to manufacture the engines, since the Government does not possess sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to manufacture new CFM56-7B27AE core engines, any contractor (other than CFM) must either team/partner with CFM or obtain a license from CFM for the technical data.

In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.  Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business&rsquo; General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost.  The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14.  If the prime is a joint venture, the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.



SUBMISSION DETAILS



Interested persons (respondents), other than CFM, must submit an UNCLASSIFIED capability statement.



Each capability statement shall include/address at a minimum:



(1) Small/Large Business Status:  A company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), DUNS Number, SAM Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), CAGE Code, and a statement regarding current small/large business status.  Respondents to this notice must indicate whether they qualify as a Small, Small Disadvantaged, Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-Owned, 8(a), Hub Zone or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern.  If claiming small business status, provide an explanation of your company&#39;s ability to perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.

(2) Business:

(a) If the interested party&rsquo;s approach is to deliver the engines as a CFM-certified new engine dealer, the capability statement must demonstrate that the interested party currently possesses such a certification or, in the alternative, may submit a letter of intent signed by CFM indicating that CFM intends to confer such a certification on the interested party within a timeframe that will enable the interested party to timely fulfill NAVAIR&rsquo;s delivery requirements as described in the Required Capabilities section above.

(b) If the interested party&rsquo;s approach is to manufacture the engines, due to the fact that CFM is the only entity with sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, the interested party must demonstrate that it currently possesses or has authorized access to the necessary technical data, or has a viable plan to obtain, generate, or otherwise secure authorized access to the necessary technical data, and that it will be maintained throughout the duration of the effort.

(3) Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the Capability Statement.



Data Markings.  In order to complete its review, NAVAIR must be able to share a respondent&rsquo;s information both within the Government and with covered Government support contractors as defined in DFARS clause 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data&mdash;Noncommercial Items (FEB 2014).  Any responses marked in a manner that will not permit such review may be returned without being assessed or considered.  All submissions must include a statement which clearly allows for the information to be disclosed with covered Government support contractors.



Interested parties are advised against submitting a Capability Statement that merely mimics information in this Notice, provides brochure-like information, or provides general information.  Responses to this Notice are not to exceed 20 pages in length on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margins and font no smaller than 10 point Times New Roman.

INTRODUCTION



The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a solicitation, negotiate and award an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity contract to Aviall Services Inc. (Aviall), located in Texas, on an other than full and open competition basis, for the procurement of new Quick Engine Change/Engine Build Up components (QECs/EBUs) and the mating of those QECs/EBUs to CFM56-7B27AE and CFM56-7B24E core engines for P-8A Poseidon and C-40 Clipper aircraft, respectively. 



Planned ordering quantities are:

-Annual Minimums:  1 QEC/EBU and the mating of that QEC/EBU to 1 core engine

-Annual Maximums:  Approximately 7 QECs/EBUs and the mating of the QECs/EBUs to 7 P-8A engines; and 1 QEC/EBU and the mating of that QEC/EBU to 1 C-40 core engine

-Grand Total:  Approximately 32 QECs/EBUs and the mating of the QECs/EBUs to 32 P-8A engines; and 2 QECs/EBUs and the mating of the QECs/EBUs to 2 C-40 core engines



Order delivery requirements are:

-Each QEC/EBU is new

-Each delivery unit includes 1 QEC/EBU mated to a Government-furnished core engine

-First delivery unit to be delivered at or before 16 months after order placement

-Subsequent delivery units:  1 per month



Initial contract award is planned to occur during either fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 or first quarter of FY 2024.  



ELIGIBILITY



The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement is 2840 and the NAICS code is 336412.



PROGRAM BACKGROUND



Each QEC/EBU provides all the hardware needed to attach and integrate the aircraft engine onto the aircraft.  Aviall, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company is the QEC/EBU Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  As the OEM, Aviall is the only company that possesses the complete set of technical data for manufacturing QECs/EBUs and mating those QECs/EBUs to CFM56-7B27AE and CFM56-7B24E core engines for P-8A Poseidon and C-40 Clipper aircraft.



REQUIRED CAPABILITIES



For each of the five ordering periods planned to begin during either fourth quarter of Government FY 2023 or the first quarter of FY 2024, the contractor shall manufacture new QECs/EBUs and mate those QECs/EBUs to Government-furnished CFM56-7B27AE and CFM56-7B24E core engines in accordance with the above described Order delivery requirements and for each order that falls within the above described Planned ordering quantities.  Since the Government does not possess sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, any contractor (other than Aviall) must either team/partner with Aviall or obtain a license from Aviall for the technical data.  The contractor shall provide the facilities, equipment, material, technical data, and qualified personnel to accomplish the manufacture of new QECs/EBUs and the mating of those QECs/EBUs to Government-furnished CFM56-7B27AE and CFM56-7B24E core engines.

In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.  Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business&rsquo; General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost.  The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14.  If the prime is a joint venture, the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.



SUBMISSION DETAILS



Interested persons (respondents), other than Aviall, must submit an UNCLASSIFIED capability statement.



Each capability statement shall include/address at a minimum:



(1) Small/Large Business Status:  A company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), DUNS Number, CAGE Code, and a statement regarding current small/large business status.  Respondents to this notice must indicate whether they qualify as a Small, Small Disadvantaged, Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-Owned, 8(a), Hub Zone or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern.  If claiming small business status, provide an explanation of your company&#39;s ability to perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.

(2) Business:  Due to the fact that Aviall is the only entity with sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, each interested party (other than AVIALL) must include either (1) a teaming agreement (or equivalent document) signed by AVIALL indicating agreement to partner with or be a subcontractor to the interested party for the contemplated procurement; or (2) a document signed by AVIALL indicating agreement to offer a license to the interested party for the technical data.

(3) Execution:  A description of the technical approach for commencing the effort at the estimated award date of either fourth quarter of Government FY 2023 or the first quarter of FY 2024.

(4) Experience:  A description of previous (awarded within last 3 years) or current relevant contracts.

(5) Facilities and Equipment:  Availability and description of facilities and equipment that will be utilized to meet requirements.

(6) Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the Capability Statement.



Data Markings.  In order to complete its review, NAVAIR must be able to share a respondent&rsquo;s information both within the Government and with covered Government support contractors as defined in DFARS clause 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data&mdash;Noncommercial Items (FEB 2014).

ELIGIBILITY



The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement is 2840 and the NAICS code is 336412.



PROGRAM BACKGROUND



CFM International (CFM), Cincinnati, OH is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The CFM56-7B27AE and CFM56-7B24E engines meet all requirements set forth by the NAVAIR Airworthiness Authority and are essential for maintaining configuration consistency throughout the P-8 and C-40 aircraft fleets.  As the OEM, CFM is the only company that possesses the complete set of technical data for those engines.



REQUIRED CAPABILITIES



For each of the five ordering periods planned to begin during either fourth quarter of Government FY 2023 or the first quarter of FY 2024, the contractor shall manufacture and deliver new core engines in accordance with the above described Order delivery requirements and for each order that falls within the above described Planned ordering quantities.  Since the Government does not possess sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, any contractor (other than CFM) must either team/partner with CFM or obtain a license from CFM for the technical data.  The contractor shall provide the facilities, equipment, material, technical data, and qualified personnel to accomplish the manufacture and delivery of the core engines.

In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.  Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business&rsquo; General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost.  The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14.  If the prime is a joint venture, the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.



SUBMISSION DETAILS



Interested persons (respondents), other than CFM, must submit an UNCLASSIFIED capability statement.



Each capability statement shall include/address at a minimum:



(1) Small/Large Business Status:  A company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), DUNS Number, CAGE Code, and a statement regarding current small/large business status.

If claiming small business status, provide an explanation of your company&#39;s ability to perform at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.

(2) Business:  Due to the fact that CFM is the only entity with sufficient technical data that a contractor would require in order for that contractor to fulfill these planned requirements, each interested party (other than CFM) must include either (1) a teaming agreement (or equivalent document) signed by CFM indicating agreement to partner with or be a subcontractor to the interested party for the contemplated procurement; or (2) a document signed by CFM indicating agreement to offer a license to the interested party for the technical data.

(3) Execution:  A description of the technical approach for commencing the effort at the estimated award date of either fourth quarter of Government FY 2023 or the first quarter of FY 2024.

(4) Experience:  A description of previous (awarded within last 3 years) or current relevant contracts.

NAVAIR intends to award up to two FAR Part 12 Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contracts (MACs) with five one-year ordering periods.  Planned award date is during either fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 or first quarter of Government FY 2025.  The services are currently being performed by The Boeing Company (Boeing) of Seattle, Washington under IDIQ MAC N0001918D0113 and Standard Aero Inc. of San Antonio, TX under IDIQ MAC N0001918D0110.  Each of the existing contracts includes firm fixed price (FFP) and time-and-materials (T&amp;M) contract line item numbers (CLINs).  The final ordering period of each contract ends after 15 October 2024.



THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine potential and eligible large and small businesses, other than Boeing and Standard Aero, capable of providing the services described herein prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal.  The information received will also be utilized by the Government in developing its acquisition/contracting strategy and Statement of Work/Performance Work Statement.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.



ELIGIBILITY



The PSC for this requirement is J028; the NAICS is 488190 with a small business size standard of $35.0 million. All interested businesses are encouraged to respond.  Specifically, the Government is evaluating the possibility of establishing this requirement as a Small Business Set-Aside.



PROGRAM BACKGROUND



Two CFM56-7B27A/3 series engines power each P-8A Poseidon test aircraft and two CFM56-7B27AE series engines power each fleet aircraft.  CFM is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of these engines.  Each Ready for Issue (RFI) engine includes not only a core engine (CFM56-7B27 A/3 series or CFM56-7B27AE series) but also an Engine Buildup Unit (EBU).  Boeing is the OEM of the EBU.  The first P-8A test aircraft was delivered to the Government in October 2009.  P-8A aircraft, including the engines, continue to be produced for the U.S. and various foreign countries.  As previously stated, P-8A aircraft engines are currently receiving depot level maintenance and repair via orders issued under the ongoing IDIQ MACs which were awarded in February 2018.



ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE



As previously stated, NAVAIR intends to award up to two IDIQ MACs in either fourth quarter Government FY 2024 or first quarter Government FY 2025.  Each IDIQ MAC is planned to include five one-year ordering periods.



ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TYPE



Each IDIQ MAC is planned to be a FAR Part 12 Commercial Item contract which includes FFP and T&amp;M CLINs.



REQUIREMENTS



It is anticipated that each IDIQ MAC will enable NAVAIR to procure on behalf of the United States, Australia, and other FMS countries, scheduled and unscheduled depot-level maintenance and repair of CFM56-7B27A/3 and CFM56-7B27AE engines, primarily at the contractor&rsquo;s facilities, but also, in rare cases, either within or outside of the Continental United States at field activities&rsquo; main operating bases or at deployed locations.  Except for a limited amount of P-8A unique Government Furnished Equipment, each contractor shall furnish all facilities, labor, services, equipment, tools, parts, materials, and consumables to fulfill requirements.  Each contractor shall maintain an up-to-date technical library.  Each contractor shall be a Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 145 certified repair station and a CFM-certified engine Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) provider.



In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work themselves in terms of cost of performance.  Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business&rsquo; General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost.  The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14.  If the prime is a joint venture, the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.

5f85b97ef1c14fdfbd3fbde8eb2541bb,N00019-22-RFPREQ-APM207-0369,C-40A CFM56-7B24 Engine Overhaul ROM,"INTRODUCTION

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Tactical Airlift Program Office (PMA-207), Patuxent River, MD is conducting market research to identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities, and experience to successfully perform the multiple C-40A CFM56-7B24 engine overhauls beginning as early as 2025 and occurring over a three to five year period. NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Request for Information (RFI) to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budget assumptions, and Statement of Work (SOW) for this effort and to determine if any Small Business Set-Aside opportunities exist. All Small Business Set-Aside categories will be considered.



BACKGROUND

The C-40A aircraft is a Boeing 737-700C commercial-derivative cargo/transport/Extended Range Twin Engine Operations (ETOPS) aircraft that is Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 25 certified and operated by the United States Navy (USN) and soon to be operated by the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The aircraft are equipped with CFM56-7B24 engines and have been modified with Government unique items with supplement type certifications.



ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE

Respondents shall submit a unit price estimate in Calendar Year 2022 dollars for the overhaul of CFM56-7B24 Singular Angular Combustion (SAC) engines or Tech Insertion (TI) engines using the CFM Work Scope Planning Guide (WSPG), dated March 2021 (see page 16 for overhaul and build specification to 10,000 and 20,000 cycle repair level options). At this time, the Government anticipates 10 &ndash; 20 engine overhauls will be required over a three to five year period. The initial 10 engines will be SAC engines. Approximately halfway into that period, some TI engines will be overhauled as well. The Contractor shall ensure the inspection and overhaul facilities hold and maintain an appropriate FAA Part 145 Air Agency Certificates for the CFM56-7B24 engine. Overhauls will be performed at approximately 14,500 flight cycles. Overhaul turn-around-time shall be 120 days between shipping to and shipping from the vendor.

The ROM shall not include the price of shipping and shall contain two alternate estimates:


	Core Performance Restoration and replacement of the Core and LPT LLP hardware and the incorporation of all CFM Category 1-4 Service actions, which should yield 10,000 cycles of on-wing time before the next forced shop visit; and
	Core Performance Restoration and replacement of all LLP hardware (Fan, Core, LPT) and the incorporation of all CFM Category 1-4 Service actions, which should yield 20,000 cycles of on-wing time before the next forced shop visit.


The price estimates shall include:


	The labor required to perform the initial inspection, provide inventory control, and complete the initial teardown report;
	All labor, parts, and material required to complete the overhaul; and
	The repair/overhaul or replacement and re-installation of components and assemblies.


Provisions for Over and Above (O&amp;A) will be incorporated into a resultant contract for discrepancies found during the engine inspection, deemed to be out-of-scope.

The scope will not include support equipment overhaul. The Government is considering the incorporation of trailer inspection and repair, but cannot confirm at this time that the work will be included in the Statement of Work (SOW), therefore, it should not be included in the ROM



CABILITY STATEMENT

In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(A), the modification was issued on a sole-source basis because the Navy&rsquo;s need for the services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would result in unacceptable delays.  The Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity is attached to this Notice.  The two IDIQ MAC contractors are Standard Aero [Contract N0001918D0110] and Boeing [Contract N0001918D0113].  Pursuant to and in accordance with each contract, NAVAIR conducted a competition between the two IDIQ contractors for Option Period 2 (FY2020 ordering period).  As to Period 2 engine inductions, Boeing was selected as the Primary Awardee and Standard Aero was selected as the Secondary Awardee.  The order currently procures depot level maintenance and repair of P-8A Poseidon aircraft CFM56-7B27 engines. To maintain Fleet readiness, the instant modification will procure the same services for four additional CFM56-7B27 engines.

Planned award is September 2020 with all deliveries completed not later than September 2021.



The effort will be procured pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, &ldquo;Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.&rdquo;  CFM is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the CFM56-7B27AE engine, which is the only certified engine for the P-8A.  As the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the CFM56-7B27 engine, CFM is the only company that possesses the complete set of technical data and drawings to manufacture CFM56-7B27AE SermeTel Coated Front Stator HPC Cases.  NAVAIR does not have access to the relevant source data to independently verify that CFM56-7B27AE SermeTel Coated Front Stator HPC Cases from another source meet specifications.  Therefore, CFM is the only source capable of timely fulfilling the requirements.



BACKGROUND:

The CFM56-7B27AE is the only engine certified for the P-8A and CFM56-7B27AE SermeTel Coated High Pressure Compressor Stator Cases are required to maintain configuration consistency with the engines and aircraft that have been delivered.

The information provided in response to this RFI/SSS is for discussion purposes, and any potential strategy developed from this discussion would be the subject of a separate future announcement.
DISCLAIMERS: As stated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers, and shall not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. As stated in FAR 52.215-3, ""Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes""; the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI/SSS or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except possibly as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, ""Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs.""
The information received in response to this RFI/SSS may be utilized by the United States Air Force (USAF) in developing an acquisition strategy and requirement documents (i.e.; Statement of Objectives, Performance Work Statement, or Purchase Description). The Government requests non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI/SSS. However, should proprietary information or trade secrets be submitted, it should be clearly identified and marked ""PROPRIETARY"", and handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for the use of any proprietary information submitted and not properly identified. Proprietary information shall be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. The government has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed. Release of this RFI/SSS shall not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become property of the USAF and will not be returned. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI/SSS. Response to the RFI/SSS is strictly voluntary. Submissions may be reviewed by the Government personnel and contractors in support of the Government.
PURPOSE: The Enterprise Tinker Commodity Council (ETCC) within the 429th Supply Chain Management Squadron (SCMS) located at Tinker Air Force Base issued this RFI/SSS requesting information for market research purposes pursuant to FAR Part 10. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or a Pre-solicitation Conference. The Government is seeking capabilities and sources to perform remanufacture of the F108 Main Engine Control (MEC) as outlined in Statement of Objective (SOO) section. These requirements are for USAF. This is an initial SOO being considered for inclusion on a strategic contract to aid in planning, however; this SOO is subject to change and not binding to the Government. The information in this notice is based on current information available to date and updated information will be provided in future announcements.
PROBLEM: The F108 engine is currently undergoing an upgrade to C-PUP configuration. This upgraded configuration provides enhanced performance and operational capability. To get the full enhanced package of performance and operational capability, USAF engineering has required an expanded ""on condition maintenance"" (repair) criteria to a one time remanufacture effort for the F108 MEC. National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and Part Numbers (P/Ns) are listed in Table 1, which includes the incorporation of any outstanding Service Bulletins (SBs) listed in Table 2, to be accomplished on all 1900 MECs in the USAF inventory at a rate of 54 remanufactured MECs per month. The organic depot repair facility does not have the full capability to meet the new remanufacture requirements/schedule.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE (SOO): The overall objective is to provide affordable, reliable, and on time serviceable condition F108 MECs that have had all outstanding SBs accomplished. The objective must also meet the USAF schedule of 54 remanufactured MECs per month, while addressing the cause(s) for the current lack of waRFI/SSSghter support and any future issues or concerns that may affect availability. Approach must seek to deliver product support designed to optimize system readiness. At a minimum, the solution must achieve the following objectives:
1. Furnish supplemental F108 MEC remanufacture capabilities and facilities to augment depot organic remanufacture capacity to increase throughput and reduce bottlenecks and constraints. a) Supplemental capabilities should include solutions that help reduce organic MEC remanufacture time to help the depot organic shop meet the USAF schedule.b) Meet all source approval requirements for F108 MEC remanufacture via Source Approval Request (SAR) process 2. Supply engineering and technical support to complement USAF cognizant engineering specific to the remanufacturing, testing, and troubleshooting of F108 MECs. a) Engineering and technical support should include solutions that more closely align with industry best practices and governmental work.b) Support should also improve availability, reliability, affordability, and maintainability of F108 MECs.3. Provide piece part product support integration in support of organic remanufacture.a) Integration includes determining quantity of parts, purchasing of needed parts, warehousing, issuing, and documenting of usage.4. The Government will retain ownership rights to all engineering/technical data incorporated into Government TOs and processes.
Contract instrument must offer the needed supply chain resiliency to the government to proactively respond to changing future requirements and circumstances.______________________________________________________________________________
