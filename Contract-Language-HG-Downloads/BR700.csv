Authority

Authority for single source procurement is provided by AMS policy section 3.2.2.4. Cite any other authority if applicable, such as an international agreement.

Rationale Supporting Use of a Single Source

In accordance with the requirements of the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), this document sets forth the basis for the decision to contract on a single source basis with Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd &amp; Co. KG of Blankenfelde-Mahlow, Germany for the subject requirement.  Rolls-Royce is the only known source that can deliver the services described below and is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the BR700 power plants (engines).

On October 13, 2004, the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center awarded a contract to acquire a new Global 5000 aircraft from Bombardier Aerospace Corporation on a full and open competitive basis. This aircraft was delivered to the Technical Center in September 2005. Accordingly, in order to ensure the aircraft&rsquo;s Power plants and components are adequately covered, it has been determined that Rolls-Royce (OEM) is the only known source available to provide the quick response, parts, and support coverage required. Additionally; since no spare engines have been acquired, Rolls Royce Corporate Care provides a lease engine will be made available should the need arise.  This is a valuable asset to this contract as the down time for the aircraft would be minimal.  Procuring an engine that is specific to this aircraft in the least amount of time is crucial as to not impact the FAA&rsquo;s mission.  Additionally, Rolls-Royce continues to provide, at no additional charge, one training course for one student per year for the period of coverage.  No other known service maintenance provider includes this option.

Impact. The FAA Flight Program requires these services to continue to provide airworthy aircraft for R&amp;D, Flight Inspection and Transportation missions. The FAA aircraft are required to respond quickly to national priorities and mission-critical operations. The Flight Program aircraft must be ready for flight in order to complete mission requirements, sometimes at a moment&rsquo;s notice during a national emergency. Only Rolls-Royce provides this comprehensive power plant and component replacement coverage for exchange and repair to the engine systems, to include scheduled and unscheduled component parts replacement, 24 Hour delivery service and world-wide coverage of components for the FAA Flight Program&rsquo;s Bombardier Global 5000 aircraft. Additionally, as the OEM, Rolls-Royce utilizes only factory certified technicians to work on their equipment and will void warranty items if non-factory certified work is performed.  If the subject maintenance and support were not renewed, there could be considerable disruption in aircraft availability resulting in overall interruption and inability to respond to national priorities, mission-critical operations, and national emergencies.

Engine parts purchased on the open market, if available, could be charged at a premium E.G.: to replace a fan compressor wheel could cost about $200K exchange and this would not count the associated labor costs of approximately $18-25K. Under the CorporateCare&trade; program, the Fan Compressor wheel would be covered as a qualifying event, cost about $100K and labor would be included.  In addition, as new mechanics are hired, Rolls Royce will provide, at no additional charge, one training course for one student per year for the period of coverage. No other known service maintenance provider includes this option. Ensuring FAA employees are knowledgeable of our airframes is a key component to the FAA&rsquo;s commitment to safety.

Specialized Expertise. Only Rolls-Royce provides this comprehensive power plant and component replacement coverage for exchange and repair to the engine systems, to include scheduled and unscheduled component parts replacement, 24 Hour delivery service and world-wide coverage of components for the FAA Flight Program&rsquo;s Bombardier Global 5000 aircraft.

Market Analysis

The Flight Operations Maintenance Office, (AJF-2211) to date has found no equivalent or alternative sources for this unique requirement. Market research shows that only Rolls-Royce provides this comprehensive power plant and component replacement coverage for exchange and repair to the engine systems, to include scheduled and unscheduled component parts replacement, 24 Hour delivery service and world-wide coverage of components for the FAA Flight Program&rsquo;s Bombardier Global 5000.

In accordance with AMS policy section 3.2.2.4, Single-Source Selection, a public announcement will be made on beta.SAM.gov to inform the industry about the basis for the decision to contract with Rolls-Royce, via single source procedures.
