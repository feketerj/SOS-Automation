The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

AMENDMENT A001:  THE CLOSING DATE FOR THIS MAREKT SURVEY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO CLOSE OF BUSINES, OCTOBER 28, 2016.

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (FIS) is conducting this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes to meet a requirement to upgrade the avionics suites currently installed in the FAAâ€™s three (3) Bombardier CL-601 aircraft.  The FAA is requesting a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the cost, systems/equipment, and time necessary to accomplish the upgrade and obtain approval for required Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) necessary to make these aircraft flight ready (See Attachment A).  This modification will upgrade the current avionics suite and equipment (currently a 1995 version similar to that found on the Lear Jet 60 standard avionics suite configuration) to an FAA and ICAO 2020 compliant aircraft avionics suite configuration in addition to meeting all 2020 ADS-B Out mandates and must include the following avionics systems:

  â€¢Future Air Navigation (FANS) 1/A with Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC)
  â€¢R3 Global Positioning Systems (GPS) â€“ Install Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) capable GPS
  â€¢Flight Management System (FMS) â€“ Introduction of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) AR 0.3 capability
  â€¢Weather Radar System â€“ Multi-scan Weather Radar
  â€¢ATC Transponder System â€“ Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B DO-260B) 

The FAA is open to all upgrades that provide the aircraft with the mandated 2020 avionics capabilities and requirements to enable them to fly anywhere in the world.  The FAA does prefer that a proposed upgrade is based on the ProLine 21 Avionics Suites with Advanced Avionics capability similar to that called out in Service Bulletins 605-34-019 and 605-00-003 Rev. 11; based on efficiencies from fleet standardization of aircraft systems.  The most critical estimate is for the cost and time it will take to complete the upgrade on the first aircraft, taking into consideration the following

  â€¢Cost of engineering
  â€¢Time and cost of de-installation of old systems--taking out old wiring and installation of new cabling harness
  â€¢Time and cost to install the new equipment
  â€¢Time and cost of systems integration of the remaining old systems that are required to work with the newly installed avionics equipment/systems, and
  â€¢Time and cost to obtain the required certifications and STCs to have the first aircraft flying fully certified.  

In addition to the Learjet 60 Avionics system installed on the FAAâ€™s CL-601 aircraft, the FAA has added additional modifications to the aircraft that may be impacted by the requirement to upgrade.  Some of the systems below will require the vendor to remove and replace with new updated avionics equipment/systems; new wiring; and cabling harness.  Other system listed below will stay on the aircraft but will require integration to work with the newly installed avionics equipment and systems.  A list of these supplemental modifications is shown below.  Those marked with (**) are systems that will stay on the aircraft after modification and may be required to interface with the new avionics systems to be installed:

  â€¢**Passenger Oxygen Systems -- SA5940SW thru Rev 01
  â€¢**AVIAC Horizontal Stabilizer Trim Control Systems -- ST00210WI thru Rev. B
  â€¢**Auxiliary Power System, .PAT, -- ST0033NY through Rev 02

As stated above, this Market Survey is requesting information from vendors who have business experience in upgrading and modifying general aviation jet aircraft to meet the FAAâ€™s 2020 ADS-B Out mandate.  

The information requested at this time is for planning purposes only and for the development of a source list.  The FAA needs sound cost and time estimations on the effort it will take to bring the FAAâ€™s Challenger 601 aircraft (22 years old or older) to sustain flying another 10 to 15 years; and, meets both FAA and ICAO avionics standards.  As a part of this Market Survey, we ask interested vendors to complete Attachment A to this survey.  The information needs to be provided as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).  This form requests information on:

  â€¢Cost of non-recurring engineering required for STC preparation and submittal for approval
  â€¢Time and cost of old systems/equipment removal
  â€¢Time and cost for installation of new equipment /Systems wiring and cabling upgraded, and 
  â€¢Time and cost to install the new avionics systems/equipment on the aircraft and meet the FAA and ICAO requirements for 2020 flights in the U.S. or anywhere in the world.  

The information in Attachment A is broken out for the first aircraft (aircraft to be submitted for STC approval) and then follow-on installations of that approved STC on the second and third CL-601 aircraft.  

Any information provided information will be determined to be proprietary to each vendor if provided with proprietary markings and will only be seen by FAA personnel and will not be released.

***************************************************************

This is a market survey for the immediate acquisition and installation of the Bombardier Modification to the Rockwell Collins Challenger 605 ProLine 21 Advanced Avionics Package.  This upgrade is for two FAA Bombardier Challenger 603 (CL-605) Flight Inspection Aircraft.  

The package upgrade will include installation on FAA aircraft tail codes N89 and N90.  These upgrades are required to be accomplished in conjunction with avionics supplier Rockwell-Collins, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the ProLine 21 Avionics Suite currently installed on the CS-605 aircraft.  The upgrade involves Bombardier Services Bulletins issued based on Bombardier Advisory Wire Reference number AW600-34-2481 (R.2) dated Dec 21, 2015 in addition to the required Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for advanced avionics. 

The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Learjet Inc., dba Bombardier Aviation Services, Wichita, KS.  This installation effort is proprietary to both Bombardier as the aircraft OEM and Rockwell Collins the OEM of the avionics package who retain the proprietary rights to the original design and technical data.  Bombardier is the only known source by which these assets can be procured as they are the only known source of providers and installation for these assets and the resulting revised Supplemental Type Certificate to be issued.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract will be used to accommodate this requirement.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.   This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendorâ€™s expense.   

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all businesses that are interested in and capable of providing and installing the ProLine 21 Advanced Avionics Package Upgrade for two FAA Bombardier Challenger 603 (CL-605).
