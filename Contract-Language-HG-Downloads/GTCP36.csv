THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF) to identify potential sources to perform C-20/C-37 Depot Maintenance.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation. 



Program Description:  The C-20/C-37 platforms are militarized versions of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness-certificated Gulfstream aircraft.  The C-20/C-37 fleets are maintained to FAA-approved maintenance standards.  All depot maintenance and repairable spares repair is performed at a Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 145 FAA-certified repair stations. Depot Maintenance would require collaboration with Gulfstream Aerospace, as they are currently on contract to provide most spare parts in support of the Depot Maintenance.  The C-20 is a Gulfstream GIV, powered by twin Rolls Royce MK-611 TAY engines.  The C-37 is a Gulfstream GV and G550, powered by twin Rolls Royce BR-710 engines. C-37 engines are currently supported through Rolls Royce Corporate Care Program. Contractor will be required to do general engine maintenance but overhauls are accomplished through Rolls Royce. These aircraft are equipped with specialized mission communication stations (MCS) as well as defensive systems.  The C-20/C-37 missions are two-fold: (1) provide worldwide airlift support for senior military leaders and Government officials; (2) Navy and Marine C-20G aircraft, equipped with a cargo door, to primarily provide long range, medium airlift, logistics support. Contractors shall be required to gain Computerized Maintenance Program (CMP) access. CMP is the fleet configuration control program and all maintenance actions, serialized control tracked items, and information must be entered into the system to certify maintenance completion. The fleet is projected to require 10+ scheduled depot inductions per year with up to 5 aircraft inducted simultaneously.  There is also potential for unscheduled depot drop-ins during this time period.  



In addition, all contractor workforce personnel who are required to handle Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI) marked as CRYPTO on C-20 and C-37 aircraft must possess and maintain a SECRET security clearance.



Any resultant contract would be considered a service contract where the Service Contract Labor Standard applies and would require the DFARs 252.223-7999, Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors (Deviation 2021-O0009).
