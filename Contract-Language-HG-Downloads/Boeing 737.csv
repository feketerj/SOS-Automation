NAICS Classification:

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code currently assigned to this procurement is 488190 with a Small Business size standard of 1,500 employees or $40 Million.  The applicable Product Service Code (PSC) is V121.  



All interested parties must be registered in SAM.gov to be eligible for award of Government contracts.  



Background:

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Program Manager, Adversary and Specialized Aircraft (PMA-226) is issuing this source sought for one or more Contractor Owned Government Operated (COGO) Boeing 737- Next Generation (NG) (-600/-700/-800/-900) series with a Primary Flight Display/Navigation Display (PFD/ND) configured aircraft where all required operational, logistical, and engineering services are to be provided by the Contractor in support of E-6B Mercury pilot training. In addition, the U.S. Navy will require initial pilot differences training that would include simulator and inflight training for 8-10 Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) instructors. The Government would assume flight qualification and airworthiness certification after completion of differences training. 



E-6B pilots require regular landing practice to maintain currency. Repeated landings on mission-equipped fleet aircraft have a negative impact on material condition and Ready For Tasking (RFT) of the aircraft.  The Navy is seeking to provide this capability in order to improve training while reducing flight hours and cycles on the current fleet of E-6B aircraft.  The proposed procurement is for a base year and four one-year options from FY26 through FY31. 



REQUIRED CAPABILITIES 

Interested contractors may submit a capability statement identifying their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Only capability statements received on or before the response date indicated in this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Capability statements received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

Capability statements submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical/management/business area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: 

COGO would allow for Navy Pilot in Command (PIC) and Instructor Pilot (IP) to pilot the aircraft, likely to be considered Public Aircraft Operations, but would be operated as Civil Aircraft Operations when piloted by Contractor personnel. NAVAIR will heavily leverage the Boeing 737- Next Generation (NG) (-600/-700/-800/-900) series Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Type Certificate. 



NAVAIR is requesting information from interested parties that have the qualifications to provide aircraft and operational support for a U.S. Navy Boeing 737- Next Generation (NG) (-600/-700/-800/-900) series inflight trainer. The desired concept of operations is to provide &quot;turnkey&quot; operational support to the Navy in order to conduct currency flights for Student Naval Aviators (SNA) and currency flights for squadron pilots. The current plan is to base operations from Tinker Air Force Base (AFB) (KTIK) or Will Rogers Airport (OKC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 



NAVAIR is requesting information from interested parties that have the qualifications to provide the maintenance and logistical support for a CAS COGO IFT. 



The contractor would maintain the Boeing 737- Next Generation (NG) (-600/-700/-800/-900) series airframe and engines in compliance with FAA practices and applicable Maintenance Planning Documents, specifically 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 43. Maintenance will include all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for the aircraft and engines as well as compliance with any current or future Airworthiness Directives (AD). If deviations are required, the contractor shall obtain them via the proper channels. All maintenance and overhaul activities for this effort would be required to show compliance with a current FAA Type Certificate, all Airworthiness Directives, Advisories and Service Bulletins (SB), Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) Service Bulletins, appropriate FAA Noise Compliance, and requirements for a NAVAIR. 



Submission Instructions:

Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this notice.  Responses shall be in Microsoft Word/Office compatible or Portable Document Format (PDF) format and are due no later than June 26, 2025, at 04:00 PM EDT.

PMA-226 personnel may contact firms responding to this announcement to clarify a responder&rsquo;s capabilities and other matters as part of this market research process. 



The Government will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this notice to the public but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it.



The Government reserves the right to release the company names of all respondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.



Interested vendors may submit any non-proprietary questions via email to lauren.a.wright23.civ@us.navy.mil prior to response due date. If time allows, the Government will address these questions prior to the due date.



Please note that under a Small-Business Set-Aside, in accordance with FAR 52.219-14, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work themselves in terms of cost of performance. If your company is registered in SAM as a Small, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, or SDVOSB Concern, provide an explanation of your company&rsquo;s ability to perform at least 50% of the tasking for the proposed contract as the prime.



This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. Respondent costs in response to this synopsis are not an allowable direct charge to the Government; therefore, NAVAIR will not assume liability for any costs incurred for preparation of responses to this synopsis.

	  Description


This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued to identify industry partners to provide and/or integrate cutting-edge advanced capabilities for the E-7 weapon system.  The Government requires delivery of at least two (2) integrated weapon systems (Advanced E-7 weapon system and associated ground equipment) within 7 years, potentially starting in FY27 (expected contract award).



In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party&rsquo;s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the sam.gov website. It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.




	  Background


The E-7A Wedgetail will replace the E-3 Sentry as the U.S. Air Force&#39;s Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) and Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) platform, utilizing the Boeing 737-700 (Next Gen) aircraft equipped with a Multi-Role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) sensor. The existing E-7A Rapid Prototyping (RP) program is intended as a speed-to-ramp effort to resolve urgent capability gaps existing within the E-3 Sentry fleet. The Government intentionally did not include emerging new capabilities in the RP effort. The Government is interested in identifying industry partners to provide cutting-edge capabilities and technologies, potentially to include an advanced sensor (MESA replacement), advanced Infrared sensor, Electronic Support Measures (ESM) replacement, Electronic Warfare Self-Protection (EWSP) replacement, Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Link 16 High Power Amplifier (HPA), Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) connectivity, Combat Identification (CID), next-generation Tactical Data Link (TDL), advanced missile data link capabilities, and other next-generation AMTI, BMC2, Alternative Position, Navigation, and Timing, and/or communications technologies.



The U.S. Air Force is seeking to initiate an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program in the FY27 timeframe to develop and integrate an advanced sensor and potentially other capabilities onto the baseline E-7 platform, or an equivalent AMTI/BMC2 platform. Following the EMD phase, the Government is considering retrofitting USAF E-7A aircraft with EMD modifications, producing new E-7 aircraft, or a combination of retrofit and new aircraft. Note:  Baseline documentation for the E‑7A will not be available until 3QFY28, or potentially later. This documentation will not include detailed drawing or analyses of any commercial parts.

Key requirements for the Advanced E-7 program(s) are available on the CORE network.

This contract action is planned to be awarded in the first quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2025 with all deliveries completed by first quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2027.

DISCLAIMER

This Notice is issued in accordance with FAR 5.204.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this Notice.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or otherwise pay any person&rsquo;s costs incurred responding to this Notice.

BACKGROUND

The P-8A consists of the basic commercial 737-800 ERX air vehicle, modified to meet Navy requirements, and numerous systems and subsystems, including simulators, avionics, communications, mission, and weapon system requirements.  The P-8A system development started with a Boeing 737-800 basic design that underwent a significant structural and system modification/re-design in order to meet the Navy&rsquo;s Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA) mission and performance requirements.  The retrofit kits shall eliminate DBFPS wiring interference with the aircraft&rsquo;s structure.

While the P-8A aircraft is unique in its design and performance characteristics, the 737-800 design that exists within is based on proprietary or limited rights technical data for which no rights are granted to the Government.  Furthermore, Boeing, as the P-8A developer and system integrator, is the only source with the necessary (and unique) technical resources, personnel and modeling facilities (some of which are based on proprietary or limited rights 737-800 baseline systems) to fulfill Government requirements.

On a previous contract, Boeing developed initial retrofit kits, a Technical Directive, and Installation Data Package; however, NAVAIR is unable to share the technical data with a third party contractor for purposes of that contractor to fabricate/assemble additional kits.



SUBMISSION DETAILS

Any interested party (respondent) may submit a Capability Statement within the required response time to demonstrate respondent&rsquo;s ability to fulfill the Government&rsquo;s requirements.  Only Capability Statements received not later than the Response Date indicated in this Notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Capability Statements received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability Statements submitted shall be pertinent and specific in the technical/ management/ business area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications.

1.  Experience:  As stated above, the Government cannot share technical data associated with the retrofit kits; therefore, the capability statement must include a description of the interested party&rsquo;s experience with developing, testing, qualifying, and manufacturing retrofit kits to be incorporated into aircraft similar to the P-8A Poseidon.

2.  Execution: A description of the approach [technical and schedule] for fulfilling the requirements described above.

3.  Technical Data:  Each interested party must demonstrate that its company currently possesses or has authorized access to the necessary technical data, or has a viable plan to obtain, generate, or otherwise secure authorized access to the necessary technical data, and that it will be maintained throughout the duration of the effort being solicited.  Note that the effort completion date of delivering all approximately 120 retrofit kits by first quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2027 presumes that the Contractor has already completed the nonrecurring effort to design, develop, test and validate/verify at least one retrofit kit.

4.  Personnel:  Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of key personnel (e.g., program manager(s), project manager (s), technical leads(s), etc.)

5.  Company profile:  Include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), DUNS number, CAGE Code, SAM UEI, and a statement regarding current small/ large business status.

This contract action is planned to be awarded in the third quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2024 with all deliveries completed by first quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2028.

DISCLAIMER

This Notice is issued in accordance with FAR 5.204.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this Notice.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or otherwise pay any person&rsquo;s costs incurred responding to this Notice.

BACKGROUND

The P-8A consists of the basic commercial 737-800 ERX air vehicle, modified to meet Navy requirements, and numerous systems and subsystems, including simulators, avionics, communications, mission, and weapon system requirements.  The P-8A system development started with a Boeing 737-800 basic design that underwent a significant structural and system modification/re-design in order to meet the Navy&rsquo;s Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA) mission and performance requirements, including modifying it with the inclusion of UARRSI. The UARRSI (Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle Slipway Installation) is a key component of the P-8A&rsquo;s mid-air refueling capabilities, and thus a core component of the modifications which differentiate the P-8A from the commercial Boeing 737-800.

While the P-8A aircraft is unique in its design and performance characteristics, the 737-800 design that exists within is based on proprietary or limited rights technical data for which no rights are granted to the Government.  Furthermore, Boeing, as the P-8A developer and system integrator, is the only source with the necessary (and unique) technical resources, personnel and modeling facilities (some of which are based on proprietary or limited rights 737-800 baseline systems) to fulfill Government requirements.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

Any interested party (respondent) may submit a Capability Statement within the required response time to demonstrate respondent&rsquo;s ability to fulfill the Government&rsquo;s requirements.  Only Capability Statements received not later than the Response Date indicated in this Notice will be considered by the Government.

Capability Statements received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability Statements submitted shall be pertinent and specific in the technical/ management/ business area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications.

1.   Experience:  Description of the interested party&rsquo;s experience with developing, testing, qualifying, and manufacturing retrofit kits to be incorporated into aircraft similar to the P-8A Poseidon.

2.   Technical Data:  Each interested party must demonstrate that its company currently possesses or has authorized access to the necessary technical data, or has a viable plan to obtain, generate, or otherwise secure authorized access to the necessary technical data, and that it will be maintained throughout the duration of the effort being solicited.  Note that the effort completion date of delivering all approximately 180 retrofit kits by first quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2028 presumes that the Contractor has already completed the nonrecurring effort to design, develop, test and validate/verify at least one UARRSIClam Shell retrofit kit.

3.   Personnel:  Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of key personnel (e.g., program manager(s), project manager (s), technical leads(s), etc.)

5.   Any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

Interested parties are advised against submitting any Capability Statement/ Proposal that merely mimics information in this Notice, provides brochure-like information, or provides general information.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a contract action, on an other than full and open basis under FAR 6.302-1, to The Boeing Company (Boeing) located in Seattle, WA for approximately three (3) P-8A Poseidon Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs).  This contract action is planned to be awarded in the third/fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2023 with deliveries to be completed 30 days after award.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or otherwise pay any person&rsquo;s costs incurred responding to this Notice.

BACKGROUND

The P-8A consists of the basic commercial 737-800 ERX air vehicle, modified to meet Navy requirements, and numerous systems and subsystems, including simulators, avionics, communications, mission, and weapon system requirements.

While the P-8A aircraft is unique in its design and performance characteristics, the 737-800 design that exists within is based on proprietary or limited rights technical data for which no rights are granted to the Government.  Furthermore, Boeing, as the P-8A developer and system integrator, is the only source with the necessary (and unique) technical resources, personnel and modeling facilities (some of which are based on proprietary or limited rights 737-800 baseline systems) to fulfill Government requirements.

It is anticipated that each contract will procure on behalf of the United States, Australia, and other FMS countries, scheduled and unscheduled depot-level maintenance, depot In-Service Repair (ISR)/Planner and Estimator (P&amp;E) requirements, Technical Directive (TD) incorporation, airframe modifications and Aircraft on Ground (AOG) support for P-8A Poseidon Aircraft.  Fulfillment of these requirements will take place primarily at the contractor&rsquo;s facilities, but also within or outside of the Continental United States at field activities&rsquo; main operating bases or at deployed locations.  Except for P-8A unique Government Furnished Equipment, each contractor shall furnish all facilities, labor, services, equipment, tools, parts, materials, and consumables to fulfill requirements.  Each contractor shall maintain an up-to-date technical library.  Each contractor shall be a Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 145 certified repair station.  Only U.S. DoD contractors are eligible.  Additionally, except for part supplier subcontractors, all prime and subcontractor employees performing services under resulting contracts must be U.S. citizens.

In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work themselves in terms of cost of performance.  Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business&rsquo; General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost.  The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14.  If the prime is a joint venture, the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Tactical Airlift Program Office (PMA-207), Patuxent River, MD is conducting market research to identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities, and experience to successfully perform the multiple C-40A CFM56-7B24 engine overhauls beginning as early as 2025 and occurring over a three to five year period. NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Request for Information (RFI) to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budget assumptions, and Statement of Work (SOW) for this effort and to determine if any Small Business Set-Aside opportunities exist. All Small Business Set-Aside categories will be considered.



BACKGROUND

The C-40A aircraft is a Boeing 737-700C commercial-derivative cargo/transport/Extended Range Twin Engine Operations (ETOPS) aircraft that is Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 25 certified and operated by the United States Navy (USN) and soon to be operated by the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The aircraft are equipped with CFM56-7B24 engines and have been modified with Government unique items with supplement type certifications.



ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE

Respondents shall submit a unit price estimate in Calendar Year 2022 dollars for the overhaul of CFM56-7B24 Singular Angular Combustion (SAC) engines or Tech Insertion (TI) engines using the CFM Work Scope Planning Guide (WSPG), dated March 2021 (see page 16 for overhaul and build specification to 10,000 and 20,000 cycle repair level options). At this time, the Government anticipates 10 &ndash; 20 engine overhauls will be required over a three to five year period. The initial 10 engines will be SAC engines. Approximately halfway into that period, some TI engines will be overhauled as well. The Contractor shall ensure the inspection and overhaul facilities hold and maintain an appropriate FAA Part 145 Air Agency Certificates for the CFM56-7B24 engine. Overhauls will be performed at approximately 14,500 flight cycles. Overhaul turn-around-time shall be 120 days between shipping to and shipping from the vendor.

The ROM shall not include the price of shipping and shall contain two alternate estimates:


	Core Performance Restoration and replacement of the Core and LPT LLP hardware and the incorporation of all CFM Category 1-4 Service actions, which should yield 10,000 cycles of on-wing time before the next forced shop visit; and
	Core Performance Restoration and replacement of all LLP hardware (Fan, Core, LPT) and the incorporation of all CFM Category 1-4 Service actions, which should yield 20,000 cycles of on-wing time before the next forced shop visit.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a contract action with a base period and up to four option periods, on an other than full and open basis under FAR 6.302-1, to The Boeing Company (Boeing) located in Seattle, WA for:  (1) P-8A platform logistics management support, (2) P-8A platform product support analysis and integration support, (3) P-8A platform maintenance planning support, (4) P-8A platform product support technical data, (5) maintenance and management of squadrons&rsquo; P-8 Peculiar Support Equipment in various locations around the world, (6) P-8A platform product improvement engineering services; and (7) product support planning for transitioning the P-8A platform from production to sustainment.  The aforementioned services are planned to support the U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, and various FMS countries.  Award is planned to occur in either the fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2022 or the first quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2023.

DISCLAIMER

This Notice is issued in accordance with FAR 5.204.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this Notice.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or otherwise pay any person&rsquo;s costs incurred responding to this Notice.

BACKGROUND

The P-8A consists of the basic commercial 737-800 ERX air vehicle, modified to meet Navy requirements, and numerous systems and subsystems, including simulators, avionics, communications, mission, and weapon system requirements.  The P-8A system development started with a Boeing 737-800 basic design that underwent a significant structural and system modification/re-design in order to meet the Navy&rsquo;s Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA) mission and performance requirements.  While the P-8A aircraft is unique in its design and performance characteristics, the 737-800 design that exists within is based on proprietary or limited rights technical data for which no rights are granted to the Government.  Furthermore, Boeing, as the P-8A developer and system integrator, is the only source with the necessary (and unique) technical resources, personnel and modeling facilities (some of which are based on proprietary or limited rights 737-800 baseline systems) to fulfill Government requirements.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

PROGRAM BACKGROUND

The P-8A consists of the basic commercial 737-800 ERX air vehicle, modified to meet Navy requirements, and numerous systems and subsystems, including simulators, providing the avionics, communications, mission, and weapon system requirements.  The P-8A system development started with a Boeing 737-800 basic design that underwent a significant structural and system modification/re-design in order meet the Navy&rsquo;s Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA) mission and performance requirements.  While the P-8A aircraft is unique in its design and performance characteristics, the 737-800 design that exists within is based on proprietary technical data for which no rights are granted to the Government.  Boeing, as the P-8A developer and system integrator, is the only source with the necessary (and unique) technical resources, personnel and modeling facilities (some of which are based on proprietary 737-800 baseline systems) to fulfill requirements described herein. 



ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE



As previously stated, this announcement contemplates contract actions (orders and order modifications) issued under BOA N0001921G0006 from February 2021 through February 2026.  The period of performance for each contract action depends on the complexity and scope/size of the efforts required to fulfill each action&rsquo;s requirements.  Generally, though, a contract action&rsquo;s non-recurring requirements require 1 to 2 years to fulfill while its recurring requirements require 2 to 3 years to fulfill.



ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TYPE



Depending on the complexity and scope of requirements associated with each contract action, NAVAIR contemplates utilization of cost-reimbursement type and fixed price type contract actions.



REQUIREMENTS



P-8A unique supplies and services to be procured will be limited to items and services that require access to either proprietary computer software, inherent proprietary technical data or through its access unique resources, skillsets or facilities that only Boeing (as the OEM) has, which are needed to fulfill requirements.



The unique P-8A supplies and services support the P-8A program&rsquo;s capability roadmap and Assured Maritime Dominance acquisition activities that are implemented via a sequence of Rapid Capability Insertions (RCI), rapid development efforts and/or Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to incorporate incremental software and/or hardware improvements to existing sensor capabilities, communications systems, mission systems, aircraft systems, weapons capabilities, logistics support elements, training systems and Tacmobile support to build on the P-8A capability baseline.  Specific P-8A supplies and services include the following:



(a) research, development, integration, test, evaluation, and manufacture of required items necessary to rapidly field aircraft systems, laboratories and support equipment, new, improved/upgraded, or replacement systems, subsystems, hardware and software;



(b) laboratory, air worthiness, modeling and simulation, wind tunnel, ground and flight testing;



(c) engineering investigations, trade studies, and analyses;

8804006f33bd5b9297e13a312cb59a1b,DE-FOA-0002239,Aviation-Class Synergistically Cooled ElectricMotors with Integrated Drives (ASCEND),"The ASCEND program supports the development of novel lightweight and ultra-efficient electric motors, drives, and associated thermal management system (collectively referred to as the all-electric powertrain) that will facilitate net-zero carbon emissions in the single-aisle, 150-200 passenger commercial aircraft segment. This FOA represents part of a wider ARPA-E effort in the development of enabling technologies for long-range (≥ 2,800 nautical miles), carbon neutral commercial aviation. The other part of the wider ARPA-E effort is included in a separate FOA targeting ultra-efficient and lightweight energy storage and fuel-to-electric power conversion system (REEACH). The overarching goal of the two FOAs is to reduce the emissions from commercial aviation by developing cost-competitive systems for the efficient conversion of the chemical energy of carbon-neutral liquid fuels (CNLFs) to delivered electric energy, which is then further converted to thrust via propulsors driven by electric motors and associated motor drives. The focus of the ASCEND program is the development of an all-electric powertrain as the prime mover for long-range, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737. Current electric powertrains do not have high enough power density and efficiency to enable competitive and fully decarbonized aviation for the narrow-body class of aircraft. The ASCEND program aims to take advantage of emerging materials, manufacturing techniques, and design topologies, with a focus on the co-design of electromagnetics, power electronics, and thermal management solutions. The ASCEND program requires demanding figures of merit for specific power (greater than or equal to 12 kW/kg) and efficiency (greater than or equal to 93%) for the fully integrated all-electric powertrain systems; these targets, among others, are well beyond the capability of current state-of-the-art technologies and will require creative thinking and innovation in the electric motor and power electronics space.",Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy,2019-12-16 22:00:00+00:00,2019-12-16,2020-05-22 22:00:00+00:00,2020-05-22,,SBIR / STTR Topic,SBA,541330,Engineering Services,R499,Other Professional Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8804006f33bd5b9297e13a312cb59a1b,,,,,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/6934c2c293d1595b8ff06828a6840be4,https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Registration.aspx

The effort was procured pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, ""Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."" The Boeing P-8A team, consisting of the Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) and Integrated Development Systems (IDS) Divisions, is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the Boeing 737-800ERX P-8A airframe, as well as the sole integrator of systems, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements on a timely basis.

It was determined that a CPFF contract action was the appropriate contract type pursuant to DFARS 235.006(b)(ii)(A). This is a development program for which the use of a fixed-price type contract would not provide an equitable and sensible allocation of program risk between the Government and the Contractor due to the uncertainties related to the Increment 3 requirements.

d2605c94e1ace9e3382b57728488157a,N0038319R007F,J--The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the repair of the attached NIINs for P-8 P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft.    ,"This is a synopsis notice.  It modifies the previous sources sought notice for N0038319R007R to provide an updated Attachment A and provide the information below. 

Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Philadelphia intends to solicit the Boeing Company (81205) under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for the items on Attachment A.  These commercial off the shelf (COTS) items comprise various airframe and avionics systems used on the P-8A.   Such COTS items are common to (i.e., used on) both the P-8A and the Boeing 737 aircraft and as such are also referred to as â€œcommercial commonâ€� components.
  

Although it is anticipated in the future that P-8A COTS/commercial common repairs will be obtained competitively from eligible Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 14 CFR Part 145 repair stations, and NAVSUP WSS is currently actively exploring how best to achieve such competition, in the interim, sourcing guidance from the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which has engineering cognizance of the P-8A aircraft, necessitates procuring the repairs for Attachment A items from the Boeing Company.

The estimated award date for the subject sole source procurement is December 2018.  The duration of the ordering period for such repairs is currently contemplated at six to twelve months.   

While the government only currently has the above-named source for repair of these items, potential interest in such repairs by other sources is welcome, and, as noted, this is being actively explored.
  NAVSUP WSS suggests that sources interested in offering future repairs by FAA Part 145 repair stations, (for example, as an integrator of such repair stations), contact Ms. Deborah Zaslow, Contracting Officer, by email at debra.zaslow@navy.mil.  

The contemplated award of this six-to-twelve-month effort will take the form of a modification to the soon-to-expire contract N0038316D016F with Boeing.   

For information or questions regarding this sole source repair procurement, please contact Ms. Alicia Rasich, Contracting Officer, by e-mail at Alicia.Rasich@navy.mil or phone (215) 697-3967.

60ec963c929f9541d4f68ceb0b69326a,N00383-17-R-RFIP8,NAVSUP WSS Phila. P-8 Commercial Common Industry Day," 
IMPORTANT NOTICE:  THE FOLLOWING 3 PARAGRAPHS CHANGE THE ORIGINAL PROCESS FOR SIGN-UP FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES.
1.     NAVSUP WSS has received a series of email requests for time slots for follow-up individual meetings with Government representatives (45 minute closed meetings with such representatives) on Tuesday 13 June and Wednesday 14 June 2017.  The FedBizOps notice of the Monday 12 June 2017 Industry Day established that attendees would need to sign up for such follow-up meeting on-site at Industry Day at the close of that day. 
2.     In order to facilitate attendees making travel arrangements, NAVSUP WSS is changing the process for requesting a time slot.  Attendees who have registered or who are registering may now request a time slot for either Tuesday or Wednesday via email to the Contracting Officer Debra Zaslow at debra.zaslow@navy.mil.  Those attendees who have already registered and emailed a request for a time slot need not re-send such request. 
3.     No time slots have yet been allocated and this will be done by a random drawing on Wednesday 31 May 2017 at 15:00 EST.  NAVSUP will then communicate by return email that day before 16:30 EST from contracting officer Debra Zaslow the time slot each attendee seeking a follow-up meeting has been allocated.  While NAVSUP WSS recognizes that this allocation approach may mean travel plans will need to be made for two days versus one day or be made later than desire, it has been determined that this is the only way to treat all attendees fairly in the allocation of time slots.  NOTE: In the event that, after the random drawing, there are more attendees seeking follow-up meetings that there are available time slots on Tuesday 13 June and Wednesday 14 June, NAVSUP WSS will make arrangements for future video teleconferences for such follow-up meetings.
As a follow-up to the recent Government FedBizOps (FBO) announcement on 8 February 2017 addressing future innovative repair support for commercial common items for the P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft (""P-8 Commercial Common Readiness Solution""),  Naval Supply Systems Command, Weapons Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) will be hosting an Industry Day on 12 Jun 2017.  
 The purpose of the Industry Day will be to improve understanding of both Government requirements and industry capabilities/ideas for such innovative repair support.  The Industry Day will begin at 10:00 a.m. at NAVSUP WSS, 700 Robbins Ave., Building 1, Main Conference Room B, Floor 2 (across from Room 2400) Philadelphia, PA 19111 (see directions below).   Because of limited parking availability and the requirement to register at the NAVSUP Visitor Center, attendees are strongly encouraged to allow for adequate time prior to the start of the meeting.  
 Note that attendees at Industry Day will have the opportunity to sign up that day for a follow-up individual meeting with Government representatives (i.e., a closed meeting with such representatives)  at a point during the subsequent two days, i.e., during 13 and 14 June 2017.   See the additional discussion below as to such individual meetings.

NAVSUP WSS is responsible for, among other things, procurement of supply support for Department of Navy aircraft, including procurement of repairs of repairable items.  
The P-8 Poseidon is an aircraft derived from the Boeing 737-800 commercial airliner.   Although the P-8 carries out a strictly military role for the U.S. Navy, some items on the aircraft are unmodified 737 items.   These are referred to as ""commercial common"" items; they are also sometimes referred to as COTS or ""commercial off the shelf.""  All items contemplated for repair will be unmodified COTS items.  It is expected that the number of distinct items covered by the contemplated contract would be upwards of 900.   (While some other P-8 commercial common items have been subject to modification from 737 configurations, such items will not be included in this contemplated contract.)     
 With the recent commencement and ongoing expansion of deployment of P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to replace Lockheed P-3 Orion propeller-driven aircraft, NAVSUP WSS currently has  sole source commercial common item repair contracts with Boeing, the P-8's Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and with other OEMs for their commercial common items used on the P-8.   These all require repair by Federal Aviation Regulation Part 145 repair stations, including, upon completion of a repair, issuance of an FAA Form 8130-3 Authorized Release Certificate/Airworthiness Approval Tag or Navy-approved equivalent.
The commercial repairable items that will be included in this proposed effort are listed in the Attachment.  
 NAVSUP WSS believes a single competitive, more efficient commercial common repair support solution--one contract covering repair of all the OEMs' commercial common items--may be possible in the future through more direct leveraging of 737 commercial repair expertise.  The P-8, however, as a commercial derivative aircraft, poses unique challenges.  
For example, a key challenge in the early deployment of the P-8 is commercial common item repair demand forecasting.   Only 61 of a projected 126 P-8s are operational to date.  Repair history is thus limited.  While having many commercial common parts, the P-8 flies a military flight envelope unlike the envelope of any 737.  In addition, the P-8 does not have an FAA Type Certificate; the Navy engineering community retains engineering cognizance.  In addition, P-8 commercial common items undergoing repair at Part 145 repair stations may not be co-mingled with 737 commercial common items, i.e., per FAA mandate P-8 items stay in a ""closed loop"" with no repaired P-8 commercial common item placed on any commercial 737 airliner.  (A repaired item from a commercial 737 could in theory be furnished for the P-8 under the contemplated contract--however, such item would then be added to the closed loop and not be returnable to any commercial 737.   This is not optimal, however, because it would increase the size and cost of the closed loop pool of Navy-owned assets.)
 In light of factors such as those above, what is notionally contemplated for the future is competitive award of a repair support contract to a contractor familiar with 737 commercial repairs.
 STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:
 NAVSUP WSS currently contemplates its objectives for the P-8 Commercial Common Readiness Solution contract as follows.
 Objective 1--  
Contractor will:
           -FORECAST commercial common item repair demand, using a                    combination of:
 
(i)            737 repair demand data obtained/maintained by the contractor 
(ii)           P-8A commercial common item repair demand history data provided by the Navy (""this is what the P-8 has experienced prior to contract award"") 
(iii)           P-8A general, non-sensitive, flight envelope data (""this is how the P-8 flies differently from the 737"")
(iv)          Yearly flight hour projections provided by the Navy.
 Objective 2--  
Contractor will:
 
-PROVIDE, using such contractor forecasting, commercial common item repair support characterized by:       
 
(a)    A parts universe comprising COTS repairable items (aircraft and possibly engine) in support of U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and possibly other U.S. allied armed forces 
(b)   Repairs exclusively performed by FAR Part 145 repair stations, including furnishing of FAA 8130-3 tag or Navy-approved equivalent as acceptance documentation
(c)    Order fulfillment metrics TBD, including as short as 2 days for CONUS Issue Priority Group 1 (IPG1) requisitions (e.g., aircraft on ground situations)
(d)   Wholesale inventory management to include warehousing &amp; shipping (to CONUS &amp; OCONUS locations, including to Australian DoD or other U.S. allied armed forces)
(e)   Other supply support including, but not limited to, providing notification to NAVSUP WSS of any/all commercial 737 COTS item configuration changes and notification to NAVSUP WSS of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources &amp; Material Shortages (DMSMS) problems/issues.
(f)   Ability to fill requirements previously unidentified to the U.S. Navy supply system (""part number"" requisitions)
(g)   Flexibility to accept addition to contract of new items/new configurations of items 
(h)  Ability to accept &amp; operate using U.S. Navy Commercial Asset Visibility (CAV) system - NAVSUP WSS will provide training if necessary
(i)    Contract length TBD; likely 2-5 years (including base period and options)
 
Objective 3--  
Contractor will:
 -COMPLY WITH Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)/Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) requirements, specifically those of FAR Part 12 ""Acquisition of Commercial Items"" and DFARS Part 212 ""Acquisition of Commercial Items.""   These may include, but not be limited to, such provisions as:
&bull;   252.246-7007 Counterfeit Electronic Part Detection and Avoidance System 
&bull;   252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation (IUID)*
&bull;   252.204-7008 Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls
&bull;   252.204-7009 Limitations on the Use or Disclosure if Third Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information
&bull;   252.204-7012 Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident reporting
[*It should be noted that as to Item Unique Identification (IUID) requirements, in P-8 repair contracts NAVSUP WSS' practice has been for the contracting parties to agree that IUID requirements are implemented in accordance with the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) P-8 IUID Implementation Plan, Rev H. All attendees are asked to prepare to discuss the objectives outlined above and provide thoughts/ideas on how the Government can accomplish the objectives.  
It should be noted that Industry Day on 12 June 2017 will be an open forum with all attendees and Government representatives participating in a joint session.  It is anticipated that in that open forum the Government representatives will further discuss the objectives above and take questions on such objectives.  A period for open forum feedback by attendees will follow.  
The individual company meetings available for 13 and 14 June 2017 are expected to be structured as follows.   All attendees will be given, upon signing up for an individual meeting, a set of initial Government questions (the same set will be given to all attendees) regarding company capabilities/views.   Attendees will address those in the individual meetings; follow-up company-specific questions and answers may thereafter be entertained during such individual meetings.   It is expected that each such individual company meeting will last 45 minutes to an hour.
Any information or ideas shared during Industry Day or any individual meeting may be used to develop NAVSUP WSS P-8 Commercial Common Readiness Solution acquisition documents.  Note, the Government will NOT assume any liability for any contractor expenses for responding to this notice or for expenses for attending the Industry Day.
