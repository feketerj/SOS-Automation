	The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision.





	The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation.




The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:



Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter&#39;s best terms from a technical, all submission requirements and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is



later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary or in the government&#39;s best interests. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:




	
	
		Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:
	
	


&bull;Quotes that are not received timely


	
	
		
		
			Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1
			Quotes that fail to submit ALL required documentation/provisions
			Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation
		
		
	
	





	
	
		Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.
	
	





	
	
		The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness (Factor 3) and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.
	
	




If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue in order by price until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.




	
	
		USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.

The Contractor agrees that the Government may, at its own discretion, perform audits of supply

chain risk processes or events consistent with other terms in the contract regarding access to

from a SCRM program, DOC may assess vendors and products through multiple risk lenses

such as national security, cybersecurity, compliance, and finance. If supply chain risks are

identified and corrective action becomes necessary, mutually agreeable corrective actions will

be sought based upon specific identified risks. Failure to resolve any identified risk may result in

contract termination.

275d257c3da640c385cc3332be328dd8,FAA-25-001a,Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) Antenna System,"The Federal Aviation Administration intends to award a single source contract to dB Systems Inc. in Hurricane, UT.

The Federal Aviation Administration is proposing to acquire electronically scanned TACAN Antenna Systems, and capabilities related to implementation and installation support services for TACAN Antenna 900E Systems at multiple locations throughout the National Airspace System (NAS).  The acquisition will utilize single source procedures.  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System, AMS 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA&#39;s decision to contract with a selected source when it is determined to be in the best interest of the FAA. Legacy TACAN Antenna Systems (i.e., Low Power TACAN Antenna (LPTA), Rho Theta Antenna (RTA)-2) in the National Airspace System (NAS) are currently operating well beyond their intended service life, and, consequently, there are immediate operational shortfalls and unacceptable failure rates that must be addressed. The oldest TACAN Antennas were designed and manufactured in the 1950s and fielded starting in the 1960s. The FAA requires approximately 38 of the TACAN Antenna 900E in critical operational sites including support spare systems and installation services. The dB Systems 900E TACAN Antenna System was authorized by the FAA for nationwide use in the NAS (NAS Change Proposal (NCP) 38625; Case File JW143-TACAN-1009; National Stock Number (NSN) 0052-00-908-1002) on September 8, 2022. The 900E is the only TACAN Antenna System that has been approved for nationwide use that is still in production.  It is in the best interest of the FAA to award a contract to dB Systems Inc. on a single-source basis because the 900E TACAN Antenna Systems are independently designed, manufactured, and patented by dB Systems, and there are no authorized resellers. If this proposed action is not approved, availability of the TACAN service will continue to degrade, increasing the risk to safety and operational efficiency at the regional level. This would also delay the FAA from addressing critical operational needs that exist today in the NAS. TACAN Antenna outages pose significant safety risks for both civilian and military aircraft that use the TACAN Antenna service.

This announcement is for informational purposes only and not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal.  This requirement will be awarded to dB Systems Inc. and is not available for full and open competition. All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to Michael Jones, Contracting Officer, michael.e.jones01@faa.gov no later than 12 pm (ET) on June 24, 2025. 

Note: The FAR references cited in SAM.gov are not applicable to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as the FAA has its own policies and guidance referenced in the Acquisition Management System (AMS).

Brand Name: Tronair is the most recognized jack for the Gulfstream aircraft and is recommended by Gulfstream in the technical manuals. The one feature of the 30 ton jack we are requesting is the capability to use an air manifold kit that other jacks cannot provide. The manifold kit allows the mechanics to use shop air to raise both wing jacks simultaneously to keep the aircraft level versus individual jacks being hand pumped by personnel. Manifolding the jacks saves time and resources when raising the aircraft. Since the Tronair jack is the most common jack, servicing, maintenance, and parts are readily available and any GSE service company can work on them.

Contract Field Teams (CFT) Labor Augmentation Support Requirements (LASR) Program Multiple Award IDIQ

Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No Task Order awards will be made until appropriated funds are available. Funds are anticipated to be available in FY25/FY26.

The CFT LASR Program supports multiple customers by providing timely and high-quality maintenance augmentation for fielded active weapon systems worldwide.  These CFTs can perform modification, organizational/ intermediate/depot maintenance, inspection, and repair of active systems in the US Government inventory, such as aircraft: fixed-wing, rotary-winged and drone; vehicles; aerospace equipment; missile systems; subsystems such as engines, communications, and cryptologic equipment; and ground support equipment.  Efforts will include on-site Organizational level (O), Intermediate/Field (I), and Depot/Sustainment (D) level maintenance support at customer (government-owned or government-leased) facilities located both in the continental United States (CONUS) and outside the continental United States (OCONUS).  All weapon systems supported under the CFT LASR contract will be non-commercial and must have Government-owned technical data.  The objectives and requirements identified within the Attachment 1 - Performance Work Statement are described in general terms. Each task order (TO) will be tailored to address customer specified task order requirements, scheduling, task order options, and performance criteria.  As with any contract, clearly understanding the task and defining the requirement is the most important step a customer can take to assure a successful outcome. The purpose of the CFT LASR contract is to provide government organizations with the ability to augment their organic maintenance capabilities with qualified contract maintenance personnel.  The CFT LASR contract does not provide for and cannot fulfill organizational needs for Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR), Turn-Key Operations, Government-Owned Contractor-Operated (GOCO) facilities, or logistics-only support operations.  The CFT LASR contract cannot be utilized to fulfill organizational needs for personal services or inherently governmental functions. 

The Government is establishing a Multiple Award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity solicitation/contract as contemplated by FAR 16.504 and referenced in FAR 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity. Task orders will be awarded using the procedures found in FAR 16.505(b)(1). The contract type is combination of Firm Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, and Time &amp; Materials. The estimated period of performance includes one 5-year basic ordering period and one 5-year option period for a potential total of up to ten (10) years. Because the CFT LASR is a multiple award acquisition, the dollar amount issued under any CFT LASR contract/task order will count towards the total contract maximum of $7,009,592,463.00. The sum contract value of all CFT contracts/task orders shall not exceed the total program ceiling. The contract maximum is $7.009B for all task orders issued under the multiple CFT basic contracts. Awards will neither be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) nor Tradeoffs. Within the best value continuum, FAR 15.101 defines best value as using any one or a combination of source selection approaches. For CFT LASR, the best value basis for award will be determined by utilizing the Highest Technically Rated Offerors (HTRO) Minimum Technical Threshold Rating (MTTR) approach.
