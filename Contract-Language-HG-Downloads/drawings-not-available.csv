The item required is an assembly of parts. The piece parts and the assemblage processes need tocomply with all requirements as desribed in the production notes and subsequent drawing specification requirements. The following drawings specifications require process qualification prior to acceptance of production orders:NAVSEA Drawing 8482161, Process Specification for Vulcanization of Chloroprene Rubber (per 3.6)NAVSEA Drawing 8482159, Process Specification for Installation of Vibration Damping Tiles (per 3.6)NAVSEA Drawing 8482158, Process Specification For Bonding with Epoxy Adhesives (per 3.6)NAVSEA Drawing 8482160, Process Specification for Gap Filling (per 3.6)Per NAVSEA DRAWINGS:3.6 Qualification. This specification requires process qualification prior to acceptance of production orders. The qualification need not be accomplished for repeat      orders, provided that the materials and processes have not been changed. With each production order thesupplier shall furnish certification in writing that the materials and processes have not been changed in any way from that used when the process was originally qualified.3.6.1 Requalification. The supplier is advised that if the material formulation or manufacturing process has been changed since the receipt of qualification approval,         requalification shall be required before supplying the product manufactured inaccordance with thisspecification. The supplier shall notify the procuring  activity prior to change. The procuring activity will determine the extent of the requalification. 4.2.1 Qualification Test.Process qualification tests are specified in Table 1.

The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973,Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D.  Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E.  Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E.  (Originaland two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa.  17055-0788.)3.6.1   Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders untilanother drawing revision is approved.  The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted,the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority.        Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below.        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973,Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D.  Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E.  Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E.  (Originaland two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa.  17055-0788.)3.6.1   Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders untilanother drawing revision is approved.  The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted,the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority.        Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below.        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001.4.2.1    ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements toMIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.;4.3   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of anyinspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformancedoes not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.4.4   Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders)  Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government duringthe performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies.4.5   First Article Test/Inspection Report - The Contractor shall prepare and submit a report in accordance with the Contract Data Requirements List (DD Form 1423).

The item required is an assembly of parts. The piece parts and the assemblage processes need tocomply with all requirements as desribed in the production notes and subsequent drawing specification requirements. The following drawings specifications require process qualification prior to acceptance of production orders:NAVSEA Drawing 8482161, Process Specification for Vulcanization of Chloroprene Rubber (per 3.6)NAVSEA Drawing 8482159, Process Specification for Installation of Vibration Damping Tiles (per 3.6)NAVSEA Drawing 8482158, Process Specification For Bonding with Epoxy Adhesives (per 3.6)NAVSEA Drawing 8482160, Process Specification for Gap Filling (per 3.6)Per NAVSEA DRAWINGS:3.6 Qualification. This specification requires process qualification prior to acceptance of production orders. The qualification need not be accomplished for repeat      orders, provided that the materials and processes have not been changed. With each production order thesupplier shall furnish certification in writing that the materials and processes have not been changed in any way from that used when the process was originally qualified.3.6.1 Requalification. The supplier is advised that if the material formulation or manufacturing process has been changed since the receipt of qualification approval,         requalification shall be required before supplying the product manufactured inaccordance with thisspecification. The supplier shall notify the procuring  activity prior to change. The procuring activity will determine the extent of the requalification. 4.2.1 Qualification Test.Process qualification tests are specified in Table 1.

The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973,Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D.  Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E.  Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E.  (Originaland two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa.  17055-0788.)3.6.1   Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders untilanother drawing revision is approved.  The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted,the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority.        Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below.        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330, Engineering Services, and the applicable Small Business Size Standard is $25.5 million annual revenue.  The projected award date for the anticipated A-E contract is on or before September 30, 2025.  
The NAICS code for the anticipated Construction project is projected to be 236220 and magnitude of construction is predicted to be between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000 (VAAR 836.204). The anticipated award date of the construction phase of the project is to be determined (TBD). 
An Architect & Engineer (A-E) contract will be negotiated for the development of complete construction documents which include working drawings, specifications, reports, and construction period services. The A-E will be given written information; participate in project planning meetings, pre-proposal meeting, and pre-construction meeting as required; communicate with VA personnel via telephone or e-mail; and is expected to coordinate so that the final documents include all requirements in accordance with industry standard practices, VA standards, VA design manuals, and review comments.  
STATEMENT OF TASK/SCOPE OF WORK:
Architect-Engineer Services shall include:
Provide a design narrative, drawings, specifications, and a cost estimate at 30%, 60%, 90%, and final design stages for Project 558-25-151 Replace and Upgrade Emergency Power Systems, Equipment and Components in Building 1.  This includes but is not limited to determining the capacity of building 18 s  3  generators and supportive infrastructure against peak demand and providing recommendations to either upgrade or replace current generator sets;  provide emergency power distribution to Sterile Processing Service (SPS)  Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), Operating Room (OR) HVAC, Emergency Department (ED) HVAC, 3rd Floor Laboratory HVAC, Morgue HVAC, Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) Department HVAC, Computed Thermography (CT) Department HVAC, Garage B, and other critical equipment per Facilities Condition Assessment (FCA) report.  Upgrades should support VA 96-hr requirements.

The AE s primary project design objectives are to improve the environment of care for patients, visitors, and staff through the design of a reliable emergency power system for HVAC equipment and critical departments.  This is to avoid loss of airflow and pressurization to units during loss of normal power.

Provide construction period services which shall include site visits, submittal and RFI review, changes, cost estimation, and as-built preparation.

Provide the number of site visits necessary for discovery during Phase I-Investigative Service/Schematic Design/Other Related Services to prepare documents for Phase II-Design Development and Phase III-Construction Documents not listed under Phase IV-Construction Period Services.

All work to be performed for this project must meet all National Fire Protection Association Codes and Standards (NFPA); National Electric Code (NEC); National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA); Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007); Underwriters Laboratory, Inc. (UL); International Code Council Codes; Applicable VA Design Guides, Design Manuals and Standards located on the Office of Construction Management Website (http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/index.asp); Federal, State, and Local regulations and codes; and Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards and guidelines.

Design must adhere to the following energy requirements:

All new construction shall be designed to achieve an energy consumption level that is at least 30% below the level achieved under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2010, if life cycle cost effective. Use Appendix G of American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Condition Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2010 to document the energy savings.

Should the 30% reduction in energy consumption prove not to be life cycle cost effective, then the A/E shall evaluate alternative designs at 5% successive decrements to identify the most energy-efficient design that is life cycle cost effective.

The following parameters shall be used for performing the analysis:

20-year life-cycle period for system comparisons
Use Public domain programs such as TRACE, E-CUBE, Carrier E20-II, etc.
7% Discount Factor
Neither includes taxes, nor insurance while computing cost.
Design and construction shall be done in such a way that facility will always meet emergency power required under Joint Commission (J.C.) and VHA Standards.

Deliverables:

Narratives with Calculations:  Written narratives shall be used as part of each design submission.  The narrative should be used to elaborate on and provide an explanation of key design decisions by A/E and/or the VA, objectives, obstacles, alternatives and resolutions, design issues or decisions relating to constructability, and in general to communicate all information relevant to the design submission. The narrative shall also include printouts of the calculations that include and are not limited to the following: HVAC load calculations, plumbing calculations, fire protection calculations, electrical power calculations, lighting calculations, and structural calculations. Calculations shall compute as far back in the system as necessary to prove if existing system can support connections to renovations/new construction.

Design Scope:  Once alternatives/options are selected, A/E shall develop and provide a complete set of hard and electronic drawings and specifications for bidding and construction purposes which encompass the previously selected options.  The package shall contain Architectural and MEP drawings of sufficient detail that the construction contractor can accomplish the modifications with a minimum of additional guidance.  Additionally, the A/E shall provide a detailed cost estimate of the project construction costs, phasing plan for installation which includes a 4-week lead time for major outages for the use of VA COR and a constructability analysis identifying the most efficient, cost-effective ways to accomplish the construction while allowing for the least disruption of hospital operations. The following A/E design submissions shall be in accordance with the A/E requirements listed on the VA website:

Part I:  Feasibility Study/Options:  Prior to the initiation of any detailed design, the A/E shall, in conjunction with representatives of the Engineering Department, conduct inspections of the existing facilities, live peak load demand analysis, develop various alternatives, and conduct a feasibility analysis of these alternatives.

FAR Clause 52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price appliesas amended herein. All product audits performed at the discretionof the DCMA QAR must be conducted by witnessing contractorinspections or tests on a non-interference basis. (e.g., whenadvance notification is furnished of the time contractor inspectionsor tests will be performed, and that time arises and the QAR isunavailable, the contractor may proceed. Verification must thenbe accomplished by records review.)2. The contractor must establish, implement, document andmaintain a quality system that ensures conformance to allapplicable requirements of ISO9001:2015 ""Quality ManagementSystems - Requirements /AS9100D ""Quality ManagementSystems - Requirements for Aviation, Space and DefenseOrganizations"" and a calibration system that addresses theelements of ISO-10012, ANSI/NCSL Z540.3 or an equivalentprogram approved by the Navy.3. The government reserves the right to assess the contractor'scompliance to its documented quality system throughout theperformance of this contract. The quality system procedures,planning, and all other documentation, media, and data whichcomprise the quality system must be made available to thegovernment for their review and use. The acceptance ofnonconforming supplies is a prerogative of and shall be asprescribed by the government. The government reserves the rightto disapprove the quality system or portions thereof when it fails tomeet its intended objectives.4. The contractor must not make any Class I engineering changes tothe contract/purchase order items, including, but not limited to, theitem's hardware, software or firmware, unless approved by theappropriate technical authority, and modified into the contract by theProcurement Contracting Officer (PCO). Class II engineering changesmust be reviewed and concurred with by the designated Governmentrepresentative. Guidance on how to submit a proposed engineeringchange may be obtained from the PCO.5. The contractor must not deliver any item for acceptance by theGovernment that incorporates a known departure from technical orcontractual requirements unless a request for variance has beenapproved. Authorized variances are a temporary departure from therequirements only and do not authorize a change to the item'sconfiguration baseline. Critical and major variances must beapproved by the appropriate technical authority and modified intothe contract by the PCO prior to acceptance. Minor variances mustbe reviewed and concurred with by the designated Governmentrepresentative ( e.g. DCMA) prior to acceptance.No drawings are available for this Request for Quotation.",DLA Aviation,2025-03-21 14:19:24.797000+00:00,2025-03-21,2025-04-07 20:30:00+00:00,2025-04-07,America/New_York,Solicitation,,336413,Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing ,1680,Miscellaneous Aircraft Accessories and Components,,Telephone: 2157375619,MICHAEL.KNEBLE@DLA.MIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,97AS,SPRPA1,"DLA AVIATION AT PHILADELPHIA, PA",d6c315fdbb0043a4aaa0a3695283cdbf,MICHAEL.KNEBLE@DLA.MIL,MICHAEL.KNEBLE@DLA.MIL,2025-04-23 03:55:57.701000+00:00,2025-03-21 14:19:24.782000+00:00,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/SPRPA125QEU68-Solicitation-3cdbf,https://sam.gov/opp/d6c315fdbb0043a4aaa0a3695283cdbf/view

SCOPE OF WORK: 
Intent
Provide professional engineering services to include option analysis, phasing design, investigative surveys and reports, planning, consultation and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of cost estimates and provision of construction period services as necessary for project 658-24-109 Renovate Patient Restrooms, at VAMC Salem, Virginia. The restrooms identified for renovation shall be brought up to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) standards and specifications as well as the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility (ABAA) standards. There are 18 restrooms currently planned to be in the scope of this project. The VA will review the cost estimate at the Design Development stage and confirm or alter the list of restrooms. In no case will new restrooms be added to the scope but one or more MAY be removed if necessary to meet the available funding. Â 
 The project intent is to develop a complete design package that addresses all VA and ABAA requirements on restrooms in Building 143. Restrooms to be brought up to standards typically require expansion and complete renovation of all finishes and fixtures.

Design efforts shall include:

Conduct a site investigation of all identified restrooms in building 143.  Identify nonconformance issues using the requirements of all applicable VA standards and specifications, and of the ABAA standards.
Utilizing a rating or scoring system, identify the restrooms that are priority based on greater nonconformity with standards. Ratings / scoring shall be documented in a schedule such that the construction can be phased accordingly. For the Design Development (60%) submission review, the VA will review the cost estimate submission and confirm or alter the restrooms that will be in scope.
Provide a recommendation for VA personnel to follow up, regarding requirements of the ABAAS for wheelchair accessible toile rooms in existing buildings. Specifically, use F202 Existing Buildings and Facilities, Paragraph F213.2, Exception Number 4 to determine whether VA policy and requirements for renovations may take advantage of this exception, and recommend methods to comply to include:
Provision of two wheelchair accessible unisex single use toilet rooms per floor. Recommend other renovations as needed such as grab bars and clearance of fixtures, for the other single use toilet rooms on each floor.
Make a recommendation on whether to provide on each floor one wheelchair accessible unisex single use toilet room, and one ambulatory accessible toilet room of a lesser minimum square footage.
Examine whether on the First Floor, the single use toilet rooms constitute a cluster of single use toilet rooms and are therefore subject to a minimum of 50% wheelchair accessible.
Examine potential benefits or impacts on the Basement Floor of Building 143, where we have identified five single use toilet rooms for renovation. The benefits to examine are the expected completion of four wheelchair accessible toilet rooms with more than one toilet (two Men s and two Women s), which are being renovated and brought up to ABAAS compliance as part of Project# 658-24-104 Renovate Main Lobby. Specifically make a recommendation whether the completion of those restroom renovations will mean no other toilet rooms need be made wheelchair accessible but only meet ambulatory patient requirements such as space in the room and clearance of fixtures, provision of grab bars, etc. Examine according to the the requirements of F213.2 and Exception 4 BUT ALSO any applicable VA policies and standards which speak to the issue.
Provide a complete design package which shall include drawings and construction specifications to renovate all restrooms included in the program.  In addition to the overall restoration requirements, the following shall also be required:
A/E satisfy the following milestones:
Schematic Design (30%)

Evaluation Factors for Award
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, and other factors considered. Boards will evaluate firms' qualifications strictly on the basis of the announced selection criteria and their stated order of importance. The criteria will be applied as follows: 

PART I   TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
The following criteria will be used to by a selection board to determine the most highly qualified firms in respect to their technical capability. Technical capability will be evaluated based on the following factors: 

Specialized Experience and Technical Competence (FAR 36.602-1(a)(2)). Offerors will be evaluated based on the specialized experience of a firm on similar projects and the technical capabilities (such as design quality management procedures, CADD/BIM, and equipment resources,) of the prime firm and any subcontractors. Evaluation will be based on the information presented in the Architect-Engineer Qualifications - Standard Form 330 (SF330). A maximum of five (5) example projects may be submitted for consideration under SF330, Part I, Section F. Example projects should be designs completed within six (6) years of solicitation closing date. 

Professional Qualifications (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1)). A board will evaluate, as
appropriate, the education, training, registration, certifications (see paragraph 3-4.d(4)), overall and relevant experience, and longevity with the firm of the key management and technical personnel. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under the capacity criterion. The lead designer in each discipline must be registered as required by FAR 36.609-4 and 52.236-25 but does not have to be registered in the particular state where the project is located.

Capacity (FAR 36.602-1(a)(3)). A firm s capacity will be evaluated based on their experience with similar size projects, the available capacity of key disciplines to perform the work in the required time, and a primary design schedule. The volume of work awarded during the previous 12 months, based on data extracted from the Federal Procurement Data System, will be considered when evaluating capacity. Additionally, the full potential value of any current indefinite delivery contracts that a firm has been awarded will be considered when evaluating capacity.

Knowledge of the Locality (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)). Firms will be evaluated on their knowledge of the locality such as knowledge of local historical features, climatic conditions, and local construction methods that are unusual or unique to the area.

Design Quality Control Plan. Firms will be evaluated on their approach to ensure technical quality and accuracy of work products. A firm's approach to resolve issues of quality will be analyzed to determine its ability to provide quality design products. Describe and define the processes of the firm's quality control plan and list, by name and position, all key personnel responsible for its execution. Quality control information shall also address safety measures particularly with respect to field work and site investigations. Information describing Quality Management may be presented in SF330, Part I, Section H. A design quality control plan shall be submitted as part of the proposal. 

Experience in Construction Period Services. Firms will be evaluated on their experience in providing construction period services to include professional field inspections during construction, review of construction submittals, support in answering request for information, and support of construction contract changes to include drafting statements of work and preparing cost estimates. 

PART II   PAST PERFORMANCE
The following criteria will be used to by a selection board to determine the most highly qualified firms based on a firm s past performance. 

Past Performance (FAR 36.602-1(a)(4)).  Firms will be evaluated based on their CPARS for past projects. 

PART I   TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
