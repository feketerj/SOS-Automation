The contractor shall perform Quality Conformance and Lot Sampling Inspection for all associated features that are present in the drawings and specifications:  a. Features/attributes/requirements classified as Critical and Major on the drawing(s) or within the technical specification shall be inspected and shall have the actual dimensions documented 100%;  b. Attributes for plating, hardness, and non-destructive testing shall be inspected 100%;  c. Class 3 Threads, dimensions, and geometric feature controls with a tolerance range of .010 or less shall be inspected using an AQL of 1.5 and the General Inspection Level II as defined by ANSI Z1.4.  d. Minor Characteristics: Sampling shall be inspected using an AQL of 4.0 and the General Inspection Level II as defined by ANSI Z1.4.3. The material covered in this contract/purchase order will be used in a crucial shipboard system supporting the launch and/or recovery of aircraft. The use of incorrect or defective material would create a high probability of failure resulting in a seriouspersonnel injury, loss of life, loss of vital shipboard systems, or loss of aircraft. Therefore, the material has been designated as Critical Safety Item (CSI) material and special control procedures are invoked to ensure receipt of correct material.4. First Article Testing: N/A5.
