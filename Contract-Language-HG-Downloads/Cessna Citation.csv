The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

0b66fa55833d223927e9d98f4b18c547,AG-84M8-S-17-0002 , N144Z Avionics Upgrade Request for Information (RFI),"N144Z is a 2000 Cessna Citation Bravo serial number 926 and is due an Avionics Upgrade. This aircraft currently has a Honeywell Primus 1000  Avionics Suite installed. For the upgrade The Forest Service would prefer a Garmin G1000 or G3000 package installed but it is known that there are no STCs being developed for this aircraft using the afore mentioned equipment.   That is the basis for this RFI.  The Primus 1000 Autopilot is an adequate Auto Pilot and has been trouble free for Forest Service mission.  One option is to have a system built around the existing Primus 1000 Autopilot using Garmin equipment if possible.  The US Forest Service desires new Flat Panel Screens with AHRS and new air data units.   Dual Garmin GTN 750s approved for LPV coupled approaches, mounted side by side to avoid repositioning of the engine instruments is highly desireable.  A new GDL 69A XM and Nexrad Sat receiver coupled to the MFD is desired. Also needed is a new VP Radar and a new Radar Altimeter, with a TCAS II / ADS-b in and dual compatible Mode S transponders having ADS-b out. The Forest Service would also like the existing DMEs interfaced into the new system.  SVT(synthetic vision technology), SAR(Search And Rescue software which works great for mapping a fire), and Video unlock cards will be needed.  All of the standard paperwork ie: FAA Forms 337 and STC paperwork with an aircraft weigh performed and new weight and balance and equipment list documented with all required Flight Manual Supplements is required. The US Forest Service operates 14 CFR part 91 but meets most 14 CFR part 135 Standards per Forest Service Policy.   Suggestions for optional equipment are appreciated and welcome.  This aircraft is certificated under 14 CFR part 25 and is flown with two pilots.
 
This RFI (request for information) is Market research to find out what is available for this particular aircraft and no more.  If there is sufficient interest in our aircraft then an RFQ (request for quote) will follow shortly followed by an award for the task.  The aircraft can be easily seen on the internet by doing a search for N144Z.
