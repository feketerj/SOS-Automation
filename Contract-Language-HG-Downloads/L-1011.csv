MARC will perform technical support services in the areas of: Reliability Assessment and Reporting Systems, Data Systems Evaluation, Test Program Evaluation, Program Support, and Numerical Techniques Development.  MARC&rsquo;s unique combination of expertise and 40 years of experience with the FBM program positions them to provide immediate response to emergent problems without requiring extensive training; thus, MARC is considered the only known source capable of performing this effort.  It would take an extensive amount of additional training to position another contractor at the level of MARC&rsquo;s expertise. Moreover, the contractor would lack the methodology history, of which MARC has.  Consequently, SSP intends to solicit and negotiate a contract on a sole source basis per the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) (FAR Subsection 6.302-1 &ndash; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).

SSP anticipates awarding a Firm-Fixed Price, Level-of-Effort (LOE), one (1) year base contract for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 with a total of four (4) option year periods. For FY 2027 through FY 2030.  Security Clearance Required.  Each LOE line item is estimated to cover a twelve (12) month period of performance and will include option provisions to increase the LOE up to thirty percent (30%), in accordance with SSP terms and conditions.  
 

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, all responses received within fifteen days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The purpose of this Market Research is to identify potential sources that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities required to manufacture and deliver Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) B-Kit under Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) contracts. 

The 3GEN FLIR B-Kit comprises a set of common assemblies, including the Dewar Cooler Bench (DCB) (provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), optics (afocal, imager), and circuit card assemblies (CCAs). The B-Kit optics collect radiation in the Mid-Wave (MW) and Long-Wave (LW) infrared bands across four fields of view and focuses it onto a staring Focal Plane Array housed in the DCB.  The B-Kit components are intended to be interchangeable Shop Replaceable Units to maximize economies of scale like the 2nd Generation Forward Looking Infrared (2GF) B-Kit.  The 3GEN FLIR B-Kit provides the ability to detect threats at greater distances under a full spectrum of conflict and battlefield conditions. 3GEN FLIR enhances the platform&#39;s effectiveness and survivability by providing greater situational awareness promoting combat effectiveness and reducing fratricide.  The B-Kit is also integrated into the Thermal Receiver Unit (TRU) as a sub-assembly which includes a Personality Module CCA, Electromagnetic Interference Filter, afocal guard, and electrical flexes mounted in the TRU mechanical bench.   

The TRU, B-Kit sub-assemblies, electronic modules, and the DCB, defined under RFI # W909MY-22-C-0023, will be integrated into sight systems for subsequent integration onto host vehicle platforms. The B-Kit provider will be responsible for integrating the GFE DCB into their B-Kit design. The DCB will be provided as GFE to the B-Kit provider for final integration and testing. The B-Kit and TRU components are currently defined by the following technical documents:


	MIL-PRF-A3381791 - 3GEN FLIR B-Kit Performance Specification Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP)
	MIL-PRF-A3381789 - CPS FDE Performance Specification LRIP
	MIL-PRF-A3381787 &ndash; Performance Specification for the 3GEN FLIR Thermal Receiver Unit (TRU) LRIP
	MIL-PRF-A3381783 - 3GEN FLIR Dewar Cooler Bench (DCB) Mechanical Drawing
	A3315467 - CPS FLIR Design Envelope Drawing
	A3381792 - 3GEN FLIR B-Kit Interface Control Document LRIP
	A3347070 - Interface Control Document for the 3GEN FLIR Thermal Receiver Unit (TRU) 
	A3381780 - Interface Control Drawing, Thermal Receiver Unit, 3GEN FLIR
	MIL-PRF-A3381785 - Performance Specification for the DCB LRIP
	MIL-PRF-A3381784 - DCB Interface Control Document (ICD) LRIP

INITIAL POSTING:

This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), and Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) are conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the capability to modernize and redesign components of the AEGIS Weapon System (AWS) MK99 Fire Control System (FCS), herein called MK99 Mod X FCS. The requirements include the redesign, qualification and production of the below-deck equipment of the existing MK 99 FCS for new construction DDG 51 ships procured in Fiscal Year (FY) 2028 to 2033.  The below-deck equipment currently consists of:


	T1348/SPG Radar Transmitter,
	MK200 Mod 0/1 Director Controller,
	MK15 Mod 1 Data Converter Cabinets, and
	MK666 Continuous Wave Illuminator, Narrow Band Noise Test Set. 




The modernized and redesigned below-deck equipment requirements include the following:


	Design and qualification of a (a) solid-state transmitter to replace existing microwave tubes and (b) digital oscillator to replace the Stabilized Master Oscillator (STAMO) while maintaining or exceeding existing functionality and performance,
	Design of the below-deck equipment to maintain existing interfaces to the SPG-62/MK82 topside antenna and director as well as digitizing the FCS loop from the current antiquated analog MK200 system (largely unchanged since 1992),
	Design of the suite of below-deck equipment for retrofit to the existing Aegis fleet with minimal interface changes and minimal impacts to existing cables and ship services (i.e. power, cooling, electrical, etc.), and
	Capability to manufacture and deliver equipment that meets future new construction DDG 51 shipbuilding delivery dates, minimum production rate of one (1) below deck system every 4 months.




The scope of work requires direct, or similar experience to, the design, qualification, life-cycle engineering, and production of the below-deck equipment for the AWS MK 99 Mod X FCS. Due to the nature of this requirement, prospective offerors must demonstrate the required level of design and technical expertise, a responsive and stable supplier base, as well as the ability to furnish and maintain the required engineering test sites, special test equipment, and special tooling necessary. The prospective offerors must also demonstrate the ability to develop and update a Technical Data Package (TDP).



The anticipated contract will provide for estimated delivery of ten (10) MK 99 Mod X FCS below-deck equipment sets for new construction United States Navy (USN) DDG 51, with additional units possible for additional USN and international ship classes. Assuming a projected November 2025 award, prospective offerors shall provide a proposed schedule for the design, production, assembly, test, qualification, and delivery of a MK 99 Mod X FCS below-deck equipment Engineering Development Model (EDM) set. The completion date for the required EDM environmental qualification test is estimated for June 2029.



Interested parties shall address the following in the RFI submission: 

1. Company Information:

a. Provide company name, address, DUNS number, NAICS Code, CAGE code, tax identification number, designated representative name(s) and point of contact, including phone numbers and e-mail addresses.

b. Provide number of employees employed by company, and annual revenue/receipts for the last three (3) completed company fiscal years.

c. Identify contracts within the last five (5) years with similar size and scope to the MK99 FCS below-deck equipment design and production requirements and provide brief overview of company responsibilities.

d. Provide current clearance level and capabilities of personnel and facilities.

e. If a small business, identify type of small business (e.g. 8(a), Hubzone, service-disabled veteran-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, or women-owned).



2. Required Experience and Performance Capability:

a. Engineering, Design and System Qualification



The Navy is interested in industry capabilities and experience in providing design through qualification for the MK99 Mod X FCS.  To that end, industry responses shall describe prior experience in designing, prototyping, and full-rate production of a high power illumination system to interface with a mechanically steered director/antenna.  Additionally, the responses should highlight engineering and qualification challenges overcome within their prior efforts.  Industry should describe the role of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to achieve a digital Technical Data Package (TDP) to enable the Navy to move into an easily maintained digital-based performance, design and production environment. Industry should identify prior experience in creating engineering artifacts needed to support the MK99 Mod X FCS development to include systems engineering approach, developing concept design documents, design and production design drawings, implementing standard mechanical and electrical interfaces, and approach to Product and Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) Drawings and Associated Lists.



Industry should describe approaches to modular cabinet and system configurations that may enable a move towards hatchable and readily upgradable electronic systems for the future. Industry should describe prior working relationships with shipbuilders and/or shipyards to develop Interface Control Drawings (ICDs), Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), and shipboard test schedules that will enable MK99 Mod X FCS installation in new construction and retrofit programs.



Industry should describe prior efforts in Environmental Qualification Testing (EQT) planning and execution to qualify shipboard equipment for shock, vibration, power, airborne noise, electromagnetic interference, temperature, and humidity.



As the Navy intends the redesign of the below deck equipment to be functionally equivalent or better than the current design, Industry should describe approaches and challenges required to:


	Interface with existing ship services (electrical, mechanical, cooling),
	Methods and techniques for interfacing with existing waveguides to the MK 99 director, and
	approaches for embedded test and calibration functionality to limit requirements for special test equipment (STE) to eliminate need for a dedicated test set (currently the MK666).


Finally, Industry should provide experience in extending MBSE to meet the Navy&rsquo;s drive toward digital technical manuals and automated monitoring of the MK 99 Mod X FCS.  Industry experience with embedded user and maintenance training interests the Navy to streamline future fleet and sailor training.



b. Design for Retrofit of Existing MK99 FCS

The Navy is interested in industry concepts and approaches that enable retrofit to existing MK99 FCS installations aboard DDG 51 Class ships, development and tactical sites, and international ships.  The Navy is particularly interested in approaches that minimize requirements for wholesale cabinet rip-out and installation to include man-portable modular electronic components, hatchable equipment enclosure architectures, and mechanical/electrical compatibility with existing ship services and cables.



c. Production Capability

The Navy desires Industry to discuss prior production programs for systems similar in size and scope to the MK99 Mod X FCS below deck equipment.  The Navy, facing significant impacts with supply chain from the COVID-19 pandemic, is interested in Industry&rsquo;s success in overcoming supply chain issues and prior successful efforts in mitigating supply chain issues through form-fit-function component selection and qualification.  Industry should describe specific efforts and successes in supply chain management and quality assurance approaches to prevent introduction of counterfeit components into Navy systems.

Industry should describe current production capacity available for this program and address any start-up challenges in delivering an EDM for qualification by June 2029 and subsequent deliveries every four (4) months.



d.  Contracts and Finances

PEO IWS envisions a competitive solicitation involving the following contract types and seeks industry comments on alternatives to include performance or delivery schedule incentives.


	Cost plus fixed fee for engineering services and production of EDM for system qualification
	Firm fixed price material procurement
	Firm fixed price full-rate production orders


The Navy is also keenly interested in industry experience with non-Federal Acquisition Regulation (non-FAR) based development and EDM contracting options that could reduce the development timeline for faster deployment of the MK 99 Mod X FCS.

Finally, the Navy requests industry identify any financial terms and/or conditions required to satisfy the design, qualification and production of the MK99 Mod X FCS.





3. Barriers to Competition

Please identify any obstacles to competition in the areas of engineering processes, production facilities, test facilities, or scope of work that would hinder or restrict the company&#39;s involvement in possible future competitive development efforts. In addition, the company should recommend solutions or mitigation paths for the Navy to overcome the obstacles.

	Description 


This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  This RFI is issued to identify qualified sources that can maintain and operate the current AWACS E-3 &amp; E-767 System Labs and ongoing/future integration efforts for the E-3 and E-767 platforms. In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party&rsquo;s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (SAM.GOV) website. It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.




	Background


The AWACS E-3 and E-767 System Labs infrastructure supports development, production, and sustainment programs during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, Seattle, WA, and Boeing Oklahoma City, OK. Tinker AFB which has emerged as a central hub for AWACS operations and sustainment as part of a broader strategy to consolidate AWACS support and maintenance activities at Tinker AFB.



The lab assets also support multiple international AWACS projects on a maintenance fee basis, including projects for France, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Japan, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) efforts. This allows the U.S. government to leverage the capabilities of the AWACS System Labs to provide support and services to key international partners and allies who operate the AWACS aircraft.



The AIL (AWACS Integration Lab) is populated with Government-Furnished Property (GFP) and incumbent-owned capital equipment. The incumbent contractor provides access, environmental, and security functions to ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the lab infrastructure and assets. This allows the government to focus on the technical work while the contractor handles the facility management and support services.



Tinker AFB becoming the hub of AWACS support and sustainment is expected to provide several benefits, including closer integration with other AWACS support functions, potential cost savings through economies of scale, and improved responsiveness to the needs of both domestic and international AWACS operators. The government works closely with the incumbent contractor to ensure a smooth transition and minimal disruption to ongoing programs and projects.

Work is anticipated to primarily be in support of OBO&rsquo;s Natural Hazards Adaptation Program, which seeks to facilitate U.S. Department of State missions in preparing for and adapting to natural hazards including earthquakes, floods, landslides, extreme wind (tropical cyclones and tornado), tsunamis, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, extreme heat events, and water stress.  Offerors will need to demonstrate the capability to provide natural hazards engineering and design services for new and existing facilities at various foreign diplomatic missions overseas. 



Up to four (4) indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contracts will be awarded. The majority of work is anticipated to be completed by structural and civil engineers to address earthquake engineering evaluations and design, and flood inundation evaluation and adaptative design, respectively, but studies, assessments, evaluations, and designs for other natural hazards may be required. Furthermore, assessment and design scopes may include related considerations and require services of other disciplines given the integrated nature of building performance (e.g., seismic retrofits or flood adaptation may necessitate architectural, mechanical, and/or electrical evaluation/design services), so the offerors&rsquo; teams shall have access to a multi-disciplinary team to cover all necessary design disciplines for comprehensive assessments and design solutions.



Task orders may require, but not be limited to developing natural hazard design parameters and exposure maps (e.g., limited seismicity updates, flood modeling and map development, wind speed studies) either at the regional/city and/or site-specific scale; conducting building and/or site vulnerability assessments (e.g. rapid visual screening of buildings for potential seismic hazards, flood vulnerability assessments, wind vulnerability assessments) across the global diplomatic portfolio; whole mission resilience adaptation assessments; and detailed building or site-specific analyses and design development.  Other tasks may include research/literature reviews; assisting in evolving the way OBO conducts global portfolio natural hazard risk assessments; development of toolsets; enhancing emergency preparedness and rapid mobilizations providing engineering support to missions in areas having experienced a natural disaster; assistance in developing or updating GIS-based global natural hazard exposure data; and/or general advisement on matters related to OBO&rsquo;s mission of managing overseas diplomatic platforms and managing its natural hazard risks. The work may require travel to overseas U.S. diplomatic missions.



All proposals will be categorized into one of two specialties based on the focus area selected by the Offeror and should be consistent with the prime contractor&rsquo;s area of expertise: Earthquake Engineering (structural engineering team prime), or Flood Evaluation and Adaptive Design (civil engineering team prime specializing in flood evaluation and adaptive design). Offerors must clearly indicate in the proposal the specialty being proposed.  Offerors are allowed to participate in both specialties either as a prime contractor and/or as part of other prime Offeror&rsquo;s team; however, can be the prime Offeror on only one proposal submitted for each specialty. 



Though the Government intends to make awards in this way, all proposals will be evaluated against all evaluation factors, and the Offerors are expected to be capable of executing task orders for all work identified in the Solicitation. Accordingly, all offerors&rsquo; proposals are expected to have multi-disciplinary team of in-house and/or sub-consultants (project management, architecture, geotechnical, mechanical, electrical, adaptation professionals, and cost estimating) with an appropriate hierarchical composition (principles, senior engineers, junior engineers, clerical, drafters, etc.) having demonstrated experience and competency of completing comprehensive multi-hazard assessments inclusive of studies, assessments, evaluations, and designs for other natural hazards.



Under each of these IDIQ contracts, the Government guarantees a minimum of $6,000 for the life of the contract. Separate task orders will be competed under these contracts, as necessary, during the execution of the contract to authorize services.  Each contract will be for a one-year period from the date of contract award with four one-year option periods. Contract duration shall not exceed five years.  The maximum task orders awarded over the length of each contract shall not exceed $12.5 million.



Selection procedures and awards will be made in accordance with FAR Part 36 for Architectural and Engineering services.



The Phase 1 Pre-Qualification announcement is currently planned to be posted on SAM.gov in or around June 2025.




	Eligibility to Perform Under Contract:

	
		Successful offerors must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DOD) Secret or Top-Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding authorization, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M.  Personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at DoS sites must possess Secret or Top-Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance. 
		FCL Sponsorship will be given if needed (see below Section B). Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. 
		Subcontractors who will require access to classified information or CAA spaces must also possess a Secret or Top Secret FCL and personnel clearances prior to performance.
		The intention is to award at least one contract to a firm already possessing a Top-Secret FCL, and at least one contract to a firm already possessing a Secret FCL; therefore, favorable consideration will be given to firms with an existing Top Secret FCL and existing Secret FCL. 
		Firms who possess Secret FCLs may be sponsored for an upgrade to Top-Secret after contract award.
		Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
	
	
	If a selected offeror does not already possess an Interim or Final Secret FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for a Secret FCL. 
	
		DoS will also sponsor joint ventures for an FCL; however, each entity comprising a joint venture must possess or be able to obtain an FCL prior to issuance of an FCL to the joint venture.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. 
		A period of six calendar months from award of the contract will be allowed for this offeror to obtain the necessary FCL. After this period the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding a contract to another firm.   
		Contracts cannot be awarded until selected firms receive an FCL.

BACKGROUND

In early 2024, based on the outcomes and recommendations from industry-led studies assessing the availability and feasibility of potential solutions to fulfil the AFSC Capability Requirements, the North Atlantic Council approved the AFSC Technical Concept and its incremental implementation. This concept outlines a vision where surveillance assets, tactical control assets, and effectors can connect seamlessly and respond dynamically to changing operational situations and where manned and unmanned systems are able to act in synergy leveraging manned-unmanned teaming capabilities. This AFSC System of Systems will be able to operate across all environments, from benign, to contested, and into denied battlespace, ensuring a lower risk to the manned assets.

The expected retirement of NATO&rsquo;s Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) fleet around 2035 led NATO to initiate the AFSC Concept Stage with the aim to define a new generation of surveillance and control capabilities. Based on the outcomes and recommendations of studies conducted in the Concept Stage, NSPA has defined an AFSC Technical Concept for a distributed multi-domain Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) and wide-area surveillance system of systems employing a wide range of systems and platforms integrated through a robust and adaptive interoperability architecture to allow a variety of flexible system configurations in future multi-domain operations.  Following the anticipated completion of the AFSC Concept Stage in December 2025 will be an immediate start of the Development Stage in January 2026.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

The contractor shall provide Contracted Engineering Support (CES) services to the Project Office to support the initial AFSC Development Stage Phase 1 (2026-2028) activities with a wide range of engineering skills and expertise covering the following technical areas: Cyber;  Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Requirements Management; Systems Architecture Development; Modular Open Systems Approach; Space Operations; Communications; Tactical Data Links; Data Exchange and Interoperability; Modelling and Simulation; Airworthiness; and Lifecycle Cost Management.

2. Background
The AWACS E-3 System Labs infrastructure supports development, production, and sustainment programs during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, Seattle, WA, in the Boeing Military Flight Center (MFC). The lab assets also support multiple international AWACS projects on a maintenance fee basis, including projects for France, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Japan, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) efforts. This allows the U.S. government to leverage the capabilities of the AWACS System Labs to provide support and services to key international partners and allies who operate the AWACS aircraft.
The AIL (AWACS Integration Lab) is populated with Government-Furnished Property (GFP) and incumbent-owned capital equipment. The incumbent contractor provides access, environmental, and security functions to ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the lab infrastructure and assets. This allows the government to focus on the technical work while the contractor handles the facility management and support services. The E‐3 System AITS provides the environment to provide for the development and testing of new software and hardware prior to operational aircraft integration. This System Level Integration and Software Development environment is presently housed at contractor‐owned facilities. The System AITS lab is comprised of extensive Boeing infrastructure designed specifically to house the lab environment, combined with a substantial suite of GFP assets. The AITS services were proposed by Boeing in the 1970&rsquo;s during the early days of the AWACS program as part of the original EMD contract to allow for the conduct of integration and test requirements associated AWACS programs in a lab environment to economize and reduce the amount of actual flight testing. Since then, the AWACS representative lab environment has existed at the Boeing facility in Seattle, WA for the purpose of providing the lab support required by AWACS upgrade programs to execute their respective missions. Among the most critical customers of the System AITS lab Environment is the AWACS Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.
The respondent should be capable of detailing their capabilities of providing scheduled maintenance for air vehicle, flight mission systems and AWACS mission systems and ground systems. Scheduled maintenance activities are forecast and will be updated to the Contractor in advance of each aircraft induction. The Contractor shall accomplish maintenance actions IAW customer technical order procedures, and when applicable, per Scheduled Maintenance processes developed by Contractor. Ground Operating Procedures (GOP)s will be released by AFLCMC.
The respondent should be capable of detailing their capabilities of providing unscheduled maintenance support for air vehicle, flight mission systems, AWACS mission systems, avionics, structures, mechanical systems, and ground Support Systems for which the prime contractor or foreign partner does not have knowledge expertise, experience, specialized engineering capabilities, or data that is unique to the OEM.

	  Description


This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued to identify industry partners to provide and/or integrate cutting-edge advanced capabilities for the E-7 weapon system.  The Government requires delivery of at least two (2) integrated weapon systems (Advanced E-7 weapon system and associated ground equipment) within 7 years, potentially starting in FY27 (expected contract award).



In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party&rsquo;s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the sam.gov website. It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.




	  Background


The E-7A Wedgetail will replace the E-3 Sentry as the U.S. Air Force&#39;s Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) and Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) platform, utilizing the Boeing 737-700 (Next Gen) aircraft equipped with a Multi-Role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) sensor. The existing E-7A Rapid Prototyping (RP) program is intended as a speed-to-ramp effort to resolve urgent capability gaps existing within the E-3 Sentry fleet. The Government intentionally did not include emerging new capabilities in the RP effort. The Government is interested in identifying industry partners to provide cutting-edge capabilities and technologies, potentially to include an advanced sensor (MESA replacement), advanced Infrared sensor, Electronic Support Measures (ESM) replacement, Electronic Warfare Self-Protection (EWSP) replacement, Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Link 16 High Power Amplifier (HPA), Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) connectivity, Combat Identification (CID), next-generation Tactical Data Link (TDL), advanced missile data link capabilities, and other next-generation AMTI, BMC2, Alternative Position, Navigation, and Timing, and/or communications technologies.



The U.S. Air Force is seeking to initiate an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program in the FY27 timeframe to develop and integrate an advanced sensor and potentially other capabilities onto the baseline E-7 platform, or an equivalent AMTI/BMC2 platform. Following the EMD phase, the Government is considering retrofitting USAF E-7A aircraft with EMD modifications, producing new E-7 aircraft, or a combination of retrofit and new aircraft. Note:  Baseline documentation for the E‑7A will not be available until 3QFY28, or potentially later. This documentation will not include detailed drawing or analyses of any commercial parts.

Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.3.5   Security Clearance Required - This contract/purchase order requires the Contractor to have a Government Security Clearance in accordance with the attached Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254).4.

Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.3.5   Security Clearance Required - This contract/purchase order requires the Contractor to have a Government Security Clearance in accordance with the attached Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254).3.6   Production Lot Approval (Contractor Testing) - Production Lot Test and approval is required.3.7   First Article Approval (Contractor Testing) - First Article Test (FAT) and approval is required.3.8    ;Cage 0F1X1 is waived from FA since they have produced DWG 7052721 with in the last 5 years.
