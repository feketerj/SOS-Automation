 Aerodynamic Flow Field and Load Calculations
Background
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory&rsquo;s (PNNL) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Aerial Observation Capability (Air-ARM) project is evaluating aircraft to replace the Gulfstream G-159 (G-1) aircraft used to support the US Department of Energy (DOE) ARM Aerial Facility (AAF).
The Bombardier CRJ-200, Q200, Q300, ATR-42, and Embraer ERJ-135 are the aircraft that potentially meet the requirements of the Air-ARM project.
Once a replacement aircraft is acquired it will be modified for atmospheric research. The modifications will likely include installation of under-wing mounted pylons, fuselage mounted pylons, and window pass throughs/attachment points. Free airstream sensors will be mounted onto the pylons and window attachment points.
For examples see https://www.flickr.com/photos/armgov/albums/72157623918331175.
Scope Description
Free airstream sensors need to be mounted in locations where flow disturbances are minimal and/or well characterized. To this end, aerodynamic flow field calculations shall be carried out for the aircraft above applicable to a range of airspeeds and various angles of attack. 
Once optimal locations for free airstream sensors has been determined, aerodynamic loads shall be calculated for attachments, pylons and idealized shapes of the free airstream sensors. The load calculations shall be performed for a range of airspeeds and angles of attack.
