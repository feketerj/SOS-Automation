Individual awards were made to 46 contractors with a shared total $999,950,435 ceiling. See below for the list of awardees.

This acquisition is to procure Test &amp; Evaluation Technologies for Ranges, Armaments, and Spectrum (TETRAS) II.  TETRAS II supports the continuous mission of the test community for the development and integration of highly specialized technologies necessary to meet DoD test user systems under test and facilities needs for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT) capabilities for the following areas:

1) Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Cybersecurity, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR)

2) Munitions/Armaments (current and future)

3) Electronic Combat/Threats/Cyber

4) Spectrum Improvements/Relocation/Access

The primary objective of this contract is to provide the 96th Range Group and their customers the capability to meet the need to urgently develop and modify Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) systems and facilities and to support mandatory radio frequency (RF) spectrum transition plans as the test community employs technologies to ensure the performance of 5th generation weapons and cyber systems and begins the process of validating and transitioning to 6th generation technologies. Testing modern weapons systems with rapidly changing technologies and tactics are inherent to defense programs. The capability for rapid response, surge capacity, and flexibility to manage unforeseen events is a critical requirement to meet short lead-times and dynamic test requirements. This contract provides the capability to respond rapidly to customer test requirements that cannot be accomplished through the normal acquisition cycle, particularly when acquiring highly specialized hardware/software. Implementing improvements and upgrades of test capability to support DT and OT of C5ISR, munitions, and electronic combat systems and next generation operational environments is critical to the test mission and the warfighter.

Contract type will be established at the delivery order level and may include Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price w/ Economic Price Adjustment (FP-EPA), Fixed-Price Incentive (FPI), Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF), and Cost Reimbursable (CR) type contract line items.

This solicitation is due back 12/11/2017.

Background:  Runway Status Lights System Description
Concept of Operations:  Runway Status Lights is an essential FAA system which uses Airport Surface Surveillance data to determine vehicle and aircraft locations. Runway Status Lights processes this data using complex software algorithms with adjustable parameters to control airfield lights in accordance with Air Traffic operations, including anticipated separation. Red airfield lights (Runway Entrance Lights and Takeoff Hold Lights) illuminate and extinguish as vehicles and aircraft traverse the airfield.
System:  Runway Status Lights integrates airport lighting equipment with approach and surface surveillance systems to provide a visual signal to pilots and vehicle operators indicating that it is unsafe to enter/cross or begin takeoff on runway. The system is fully automated based on inputs from surface and terminal surveillance systems. Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), with a size standard of $38.5M.

The current qualified source(s) are ADB Safegate (CAGE 5ED70) and Saab Sensis (CAGE 6ZQN9). The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.
