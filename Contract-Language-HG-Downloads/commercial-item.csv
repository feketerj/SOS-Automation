in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing/repair knowledge by the
qualified source(s) require acquisition/repair of the part from the approved
source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing /repair
knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the
Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality
of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design
control activitys procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government
engineering activity.
The qualification procedures must be approved by the
Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the
intended application.

This product will be provided by EDGEONE LLC located at 4 Little Brook Road West Wareham, Massachusetts 02576.

NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson deploys and recovers scientific moorings. All moorings utilize EdgeTech hydroacoustic releases, requiring the EdgeTech acoustic command/ranging deck box. New hydroacoustic releases are not designed to work with our current, older model, hydroacoustic command/ranging deck box.  

Currently, both older models and new models of the releases are being used in the field, requiring the new deck box model.  It is the CST&rsquo;s understanding the new deck box model will work with old and new hydroacoustic releases.   

The 8011M Edge Tech Acoustic Command/Ranging Deck Unit properties and engineering design specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by another manufacturer. EDGEONE LLC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the equipment. Therefore, the government intends to negotiate directly with EDGEONE LLC avoiding unnecessary mark ups, delay, warranty, and delivery issues.

The Government is not aware of any other authorized vendors that can provide this specialized equipment while also meeting all of the requirements/concerns listed above. The intended procurement is to acquire one 8011M Edge Tech Acoustic Command/Ranging Deck Unit.

The Government intends to acquire this part under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items.

The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with a business size standard of 1350 employees. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any interested party that is an authorized distributor, re-seller, dealer from EDGEONE LLC. and can provide the above requirement, at no additional mark ups, without compromising manufacturing, delivery and warranty may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by August 11, 2025 at 5:00 PM EST. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. 

Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required item, authorized dealer/supplier and availability. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements.

	The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision.





	The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation.




The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:



Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter&#39;s best terms from a technical, all submission requirements and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is



later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary or in the government&#39;s best interests. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:




	
	
		Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:
	
	


&bull;Quotes that are not received timely


	
	
		
		
			Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1
			Quotes that fail to submit ALL required documentation/provisions
			Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation
		
		
	
	





	
	
		Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.
	
	





	
	
		The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness (Factor 3) and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.
	
	




If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue in order by price until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.




	
	
		USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.

			Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1
			Quotes that fail to submit ALL required documentation/provisions
			Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation
		
		
	
	





	
	
		Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.
	
	





	
	
		The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness (Factor 3) and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.
	
	




If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue in order by price until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.




	
	
		USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.

Factor 1. Technical Acceptability

COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS - THESE SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES. THEY MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLISHERS OR SOCIETIES OF THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS.6.2   Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation ofabbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423.Block A:  Is the actual contract line item no.Block B:  Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s)          which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase          order.Block C:  Is the category of data required, TDP is defined          in MIL-T-31000.  TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B          of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's          included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as          NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals          without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,          most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP.Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item          being purchased.Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,          invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and          monitoring purposes.Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code.Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the          individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the          requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP).Block H:  Self explanatory.Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content          and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP.Block J:  Self explanatory.Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN).Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4.Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if          the title requires clarification.Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual          Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event          the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered          TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order.Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement          statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found.Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,          conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item.Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and          acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the          codes is as follows:              DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                    SS               (1)           (2)                    DD               (3)           (4)                    SD               (1)           (4)                    DS               (3)           (5)                    LT               (6)           (7)                    NO               (8)           (8)                    XX               (9)           (9)          (1)  Inspection at source.          (2)  Acceptance at source.          (3)  No inspection performed at source.  Final inspection               performance at destination.          (4)  Acceptance at destination.          (5)  Acceptance at source.

The data is sent by the               contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14               of the DD Form 1423.  LT is used when the contracting               agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each               and every piece of data developed by the contractor.               The only other authorized use of LT is the special               case where the contracting agency does not desire to               have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a               Government quality assurance representative perform               inspection.  The Government quality assurance               representative shall be listed on the distribution               in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via               the quality assurance letter of inspection.               Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising               final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical               Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of               preliminary TDP's or TM's).          (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.          (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or               letter of transmittal required.               Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising               Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.          (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere               in the contract.Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring          specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of          the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""          in this field.  This data item requires submission of a          preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.          When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD          Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government          approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the          contractor to resubmit the data after Government          approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also          indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,          approval of technical content and/or format.Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the          Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition          of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:          A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.          B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.          C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with              a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the              DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,              Mich. or Government activities.          D.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities              and DOD contractors only.          E.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components              only.          F.  Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign              Nations and Foreign Nationals.Block 10:  Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to           be delivered to the Government.  The abbreviations and           their meaning.              ANNLY                  Annually              ASGEN                  As generated              ASREQ                  As required              BI-MO                  Every two months              BI-WE                  Every two weeks              DAILY                  Daily              DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery              MTHLY                  Monthly              ONE/R                  One time with revisions              QRTLY                  Quarterly              SEMIA                  Every six months              WEKLY                  Weekly              XTIME                  Number of times to be submitted                                     (1time, 2times...9times)           Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16          to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately          price the deliverable data item.          Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on          occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423.  When other          abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16          of the DD Form 1423.Block 11:  Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day           format, the deliverable item is to be received by the           requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423           for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single           delivery.  If the item is to be submitted multiple           times, the number stated is the number of calendar days           after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be           received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the           DD Form 1423.  On occasion the deliverable item will be           required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency           cited in Block 6.  In that event the requirement will be           fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423.Block 12:  Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to           the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in           year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their           meaning are as follows:              ASGEN                  As generated              ASREQ                  As required              DAC                    Days after contract date              DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery              EOC                    End of contract              EOM                    End of month              EOQ                    End of quarter       Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in       Block 16.  If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific       event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16       of the DD Form 1423.  ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred       Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16.Block 13:  Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after           the initial submission.  Subsequent submission is only used to           indicate the specific time period. The data is required when           Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is           required.  This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable           item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined           to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable.Block 14a:  Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to            be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full            name, address (including code) will be specified.  That specific            information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423.Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to            be submitted.  When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted            Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.            (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.)Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required           by Block 14.Block 16:  Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information           Blocks 1 through 15.  This block is also the only area used to           tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the           minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are           allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for           delivery of the data.Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the           appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:           A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this               type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price               would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General               and Administrative (G&A) and profit.           B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be               reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.               The price for data in this group would be based on the direct               cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and               to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.           C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own               use and which requires no substantial change to conform to               Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,               frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only               the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,               G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.           D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part               of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required               and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally               be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual               developed for commercial application which will be acquired               in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify               the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go               with the acquisition.Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total           price which is estimated to be attributable to the production           or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.  THE           ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable.6.3  In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the informationcontained on those documents and drawings.  There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings.  The definition for each is as follows:A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only.C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors.D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only.E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only.F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea     Systems Command, code 09T.MARK THE PACKAGING LABEL WITH THE NOMENCLATURE CITED ON THE IRPOD.DATE OF FIRST SUBMISSION=EOCSubmit to NAVSUP-WSS, Code N9433 for review, a complete package of all applicable Vendor Certified Reports of Test and Inspection per DI-QCIC-8872(LATEST REV) See (INDIVIDUAL REPAIR PARTS ORDERING DATA) IRPOD for individual documentsrequired.The package will be submitted per the contract delivery schedule, and authorization to ship material must be obtained from the PCO.A separate package will be prepared and submitted for each unique combination of Contract Number, National Stock Number, and Item Nomenclature specified in the schedule of supplies/services.DI-QCIC-A8872S CITED IN BLOCK 4 IS A UNIQUE NAVSUP-WSS DD1423 SEQUENCE CONTROL NUMBER - ROTI PACKAGE TO BE IAW DID DI-QCIC-8872(LATEST REV).DATE OF FIRST SUBMISSION=045 DACSubmit for approval one package (IAW DI-QCIC-8871) of all applicable procedure, drawing and other pre-manufacturing submittals, listed on the Individual Repair Part Ordering Data (IRPOD) document(s) and detailed in the cited specification, within 45 days aftercontract award to the Contracting Officer (NAVSUP-WSS code N9433).
