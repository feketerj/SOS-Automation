NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program 

The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP). OPAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, Government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity&rsquo;s chain of command.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. 

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum.

Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. 

Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, contractors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the concerns cannot be resolved by the Contracting Officer, the Ombudsman may conduct an independent review through the informal forum. If the contractor&rsquo;s concerns cannot be resolved informally, the contractor may file a Formal Agency Protest to either the Contracting Officer, or as an alternative, to the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. No contract award will be made pending resolution of the agency protest. Performance will be suspended during the protest period, if the protest is timely received in 10 days after contract award or within five days after a debriefing date offered to the protester following a timely debriefing request in accordance with the FAR 15.505 or 15.506. An award may be made or performance continued, however, if, justified by the HCA, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or determined by the HCA, in writing, to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program may be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program



It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).



Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.

 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum.

Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).



Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.

 Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTSUnited States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.
Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation is located in Stratford, CT and is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and only know source to possess full repair capability. Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
 Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.
