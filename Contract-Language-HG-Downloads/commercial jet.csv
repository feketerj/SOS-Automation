Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (A-ISR) Sensors. Medium/High Altitude, Higher Airspeed (increased range/ operational area) day/night, all-weather, pressurized, large-size-cabin Federal Aviation Administration Federal Aviation Regulation Part 25, Airworthiness Standards, certified executive jet-category aircraft.   

Synopsis:

This Request for Information (RFI), issued in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposals, is for informational and planning purposes only. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government (USG) to contract for any supply or service. Responses are not proposals for contract award. The information obtained from this market research is for planning purposes only. The USG will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI as all costs will be the Respondent&rsquo;s responsibility. The responses to the RFI are strictly market research IAW FAR Part 10, Market Research.  

The United States Army Contracting Command Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, is seeking information on potential concepts and ideas for:


	The Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA) Product Directorate of the Fixed Wing Project Office (FWPO) has an emerging requirement for up to fourteen (14) Medium/Large Commercial Jets starting in US Government Fiscal Year 2026 that will be integrated with Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (A-ISR) Sensors. Jets shall be Medium/High Altitude, Higher Airspeed (increased range/ operational area) day/night, all-weather, pressurized, large-size-cabin Federal Aviation Administration Federal Aviation Regulation Part 25, Airworthiness Standards, certified executive jet-category aircraft.  
	The Army will provide platforms as government furnished equipment to a system integrator. Integration of A-ISR capabilities will likely drive a need for wing hard points, belly canoe, and radome. The aircraft will require adequate Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) to support integration of multiple intelligence sensors.
	Only aircraft currently in production will be considered and to ensure suitable service life, only new aircraft will be considered.
	Provide a description of the services and capability to perform engineering support and studies related to Jet and potential Jet modifications required in the development of the A-ISR solution. 
	Aircraft simulation and initial jet training services related to the proposed jet are being sought.  
	The US Army would benefit from leveraging training, maintenance, and aircraft knowledge of other Joint Services (i.e. US Air Force or Navy) or US/ International Government Agencies have made prior procurement of the selected platform.


UNCLASSIFIED RESPONSES REQUESTED:  The USG is interested in receiving meaningful feedback on air platforms that meet the proposed requirements along with the information requested below.

j. List any Foreign Military Sales or International Sales.

k. State whether Respondent&rsquo;s platform has an existing flight simulator and the flight simulator level. List whether there is an existing training package that the USG could leverage.

It is the intent of the FWPO to conduct individual conference calls with the viable Respondents after the closure of the RFI process. The USG may assess the capability of a Respondent&rsquo;s system.

SUBMISSION: USG reserves the right to not respond, or to publish all questions and answers at SAM.gov. Submit RFI synopsis responses and comments via email NLT 28 June 2024 at 4:00 p.m. CDT to the following addresses:  pamela.n.pritchard.civ@army.mil and james.h.pattullo.civ@army.mil.



Frequently Asked Questiones:

1. Regarding Aircraft Platform Requirements: Paragraph b. requires that the aircraft must operate between 41,000 -51,000 feet Above Mean Sea Level (MSL). Our interpretation of this requires an aircraft that can operate at or above 41,000 MSL. And that there is no requirement to operate above 51,000 MSL. Is our understand, correct?

Government Response: Yes, the assumption is correct.

2. Regarding Aircraft Platform Requirements: Paragraph c. requires us to support a minimum of 14,000 pounds of payload. [Note that paragraph B identifies 6,500 lbs. of MEP]. Can you clarify the nature of the additional 7,500 lbs.? Does it include personnel, baggage, supplies? Is it provided on pallets, or how is this packaged?

Government Response: Yes, the additional 7,500 lbs. is to account for people, baggage, cabling, associated equipment and growth margin.



3. Regarding Aircraft Platform Requirements: In the description, the requirements are a Part 25, Airworthiness Standards, certified executive Jet-category aircraft. We do not know of a business/executive jet aircraft (comparable to the current HADES aircraft (Global 6500) that has a payload of 14,000 lbs. and can still meet 12 hours of endurance under normal cruise with modifications installed (OML).  Can you clarify that the 12 hours endurance is in a loiter, reduced power, high altitude flight profile?

Government Response: Yes, the 12 hours are reduced power and loitering. 



4. Regarding Green Aircraft: Can you confirm that the Army desires for our input on the make and model aircraft and that the Army will source and procure the green aircraft for the contract?  Would the government consider COCO operations and or a long term leased green aircraft?

Government Response: Yes, the intent is to procure a green aircraft. The government is not currently interested in leasing an aircraft for this effort.

AMENDMENT 1

Amendment 1 is issued to provide the following clarification,

The recent GSA RFI for ATHENA was for a Task Order delivering ISR capability as part of a service contract.  ATHENA is a contractor owned and contractor operated turnkey solution providing ISR capabilities to the US Army.  

For clarity, this RFI (Notice ID PANRSA-21-P-0000009612), is to support the Army&rsquo;s future High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) program of record and will be a government-owned platform.  This RFI seeks market information to determine what commercial aircraft manufactures have an aircraft capable to meet the requirements listed in the RFI. 

The RFI response date is not changed as a result of this amendment.
