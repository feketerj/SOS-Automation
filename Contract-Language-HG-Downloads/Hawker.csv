NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) CONTRACT LANGUAGE

NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)


	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:



	
	
		Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.
	
	



	
	
		Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.
	
	



	
	
		Identify constraints in transparency and process.
	
	



	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.



	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer&#39;s decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.



	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman&#39;s authority, for instance:



	
	
		Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.
	
	


                       The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.


	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA&#39;s agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).
	
	



	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.



	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.



	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.

IntroductionThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA.  Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA's prioritized airborne requirements.
PurposeThe purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about the capability and availability of purchasing one (1) multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft, with necessary modifications, to replace NOAA/AOC's Gulfstream Turbo Commander, AC695A aircraft, with the option to purchase a second multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft to support NOAA/OMAO's national mission.  The purchased aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's King Air 350CER (serial number FM21) for safety and standardization.
BackgroundThe aircraft of the NOAA/AOC are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's environment.  NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around the world over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic pack ice.  These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data essential to their research.
The AOC provides capable, mission-ready aircraft and professional crews to the scientific community wherever and whenever they are required. Whether studying global climate change or acid rain, assessing marine mammal populations, surveying coastal erosion, investigating oil spills, or improving hurricane prediction models, the AOC flight crews continue to operate in some of the world's most demanding flight regimes.
The AOC operates and maintains a Gulfstream Turbo Commander (AC695A, serial number 96089), a highly modified twin turboprop aircraft, supporting NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NWS works to provide weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enchantment of the national economy.  Manufactured in 1984, the airframe is over 30 years old and due to aging costs, standardization issues, and loss of mission readiness, OMAO is seeking to replace this aircraft.
The AOC also operates and maintains a Hawker-Beechcraft King Air 350CER (B300C, serial number FM21), another highly modified twin-turboprop aircraft that was acquired in 2007 (WC133M07CN0231), supporting NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NOS works to observe, understand, and manage our Nation's coastal and marine resources. NOS measures and predicts coastal and ocean phenomena, protects large areas of the oceans, works to ensure safe navigation, and provides tools and information to protect and restore coastal and marine resources.   NOAA's requirements have grown over the past ten (10) years and a single aviation platform cannot support all the flight hours that NOS requests every year.  Additionally, this aircraft serves as a single point of failure for the collection of rapid response damage assessment following storms that impact the United States and its territories and the requirement for a backup aircraft exists for the Nation.  For these reasons, OMAO is seeking to expand its fleet of aircraft.
AOC is replacing the Turbo Commander with a multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft(s) capable of efficiently flying the profiles required by NWS and the other line offices in NOAA.   AOC is also contemplating expanding its fleet and capabilities by acquiring an additional King Air 350.The prospective aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's existing King Air 350CER, serial number FM21, for safety and standardization.  This Sources Sought / RFI is issued to gage industry interest as well as aircraft availability for this requirement.

36f55d6d3675d69760825285ab17ee09,24810,MARKET SURVEY:  Rockwell-Collins Integration of ACSS Transponder in ProLine 21 Equipped BE-300 Aircraft,"NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

This is a market survey for the immediate acquisition of non-recurring engineering support services and software required to integrate an ACSS Model NXT-800 transponder into the ProLine 21 equipped King Air (Be-300).  

The FAA Flight Inspection Be-300 fleet of aircraft is in the process of having the Rockwell-Collins, ProLine 21 Avionics Suite of equipment installed.  The FAA is contemplating a fixed-price contract to include the following line items for this requirement.  

Line Item 0001:  Non-recurring engineering â€“ this includes completion of the Critical Design Review; research, development, identification of functional communication signals, and documentation of these parameters and requirements to ensure functionality and that these components properly communicate through the Control Display Unit (CDU).  This information/display information will be integrated between all the various components to make sure the system will have the ability to capture and process the signals and broadcast the correct ADS-B information to ground based receivers.

Line Item 0002:  CDU-3000 Service Bulletin for 822-0882-267  to -495 (2 per aircraft) for a total of 34 each

Line Item 0003:  IOT-4110 Software (RCPN 810-0053-XXX) (2 per aircraft) for a total of 34 each

Line Item 0004:  MDT-3110 Software (RCPN-810-0042-XXX) for a total of 17

This equipment is proprietary to Rockwell-Collins under Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA01267WI-D.  Rockwell-Collins owns the patents, proprietary data and software applicable to all equipment, components, software, and data required for installation of this proprietary avionics system.  This equipment is required to interface with the Flight Inspection System Equipment AFIS and FIAPA used in the backend of the aircraft to test the navigation system of the National Airspace.  

The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Rockwell-Collins as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and is the only known source that owns the rights to modify its equipment and systems.  The FAA requires the engineering expertise that Rockwell-Collins provides that includes information and data necessary to trouble shoot, analyze, test, identify and determine risk of various anomalies in addition to making necessary corrections to their equipment and/or systems software.  As the OEM, Rockwell-Collins owns the STC to add avionics functionality in the Hawker Beechcraft Models B300/B300c.  Due to the non-recurring engineering effort, this specific effort excludes any Rockwell â€“ Collins third party dealers from meeting this requirement.
