NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests and CC the Contracting Officer. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman at OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer&rsquo;s name, solicitation closing date (if applicable), and their concerns.

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program, and CC the Contracting Officer in all communications.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the government.  The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be emailed to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their quote for capability determination or for registration in WWW.SAM.GOV .  If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS item managers and engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact the MRS item managers, (252) 335-6143, 6040, 6274, 6988 for evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration.

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, the component test of the Buy American statute is waived for an end product that is a COTS item (See 12.505(a)(1)). In addition, the Contracting Officer has determined that FTAs (except the Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Panama, and Peru FTAs) and the Israeli Trade Act apply to this acquisition. Unless otherwise specified, these trade agreements apply to all items in the Schedule. The Contractor shall deliver under this contract only domestic end products except to the extent that, in its offer, it specified delivery of foreign end products in the provision entitled &ldquo;Buy American&mdash;Free Trade Agreements&mdash;Israeli Trade Act Certificate.&rdquo; If the Contractor specified in its offer that the Contractor would supply a Free Trade Agreement country end product (other than a Bahrainian, Moroccan, Omani, Panamanian, or Peruvian end product) or an Israeli end product, then the Contractor shall supply a Free Trade Agreement country end product (other than a Bahrainian, Moroccan, Omani, Panamanian, or Peruvian end product), an Israeli end product or, at the Contractor&#39;s option, a domestic end product

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to filea formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.
Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCGprocurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicableContracting Officer.

Underthis informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use ofan informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency orother forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the followinginformation to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, ContractingOfficer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an IndependentReview is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to eitherthe Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract awardor performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined inwriting to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests inless than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forthin FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of theprotest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) operates eighteen (18) HC-144 (CN-235, series 300M) aircraft manufactured by Airbus Military, Seville, Spain. The base CASA CN-235M aircraft provided the foundation; changes to the configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have resulted in the 300M series CG01 version of the CN-235M, the USCG HC-144 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Currently, the USCG is also acquiring fourteen (14) HC-27J aircraft from the U.S. Air Force to further the Medium Range Surveillance (MRS) mission of the USCG. Both the HC-144 and HC-27J aircraft require Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) Inspection every four (4) years. The PDM is conducted at USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) and includes a required external paint refurbishment. The USCG's missions consistently expose these aircraft to corrosive salt water environments resulting in the need for a high quality well applied aircraft paint system.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
1. BACKGROUND1.1 The Coast Guard currently operates eighteen (18) HC-144 Maritime Patrol Aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines which use the model 14RF-37 Propeller. The aircraft is manufactured by AIRBUS MILITARY (formerly EADS CASA) in Seville, Spain. Some components are manufactured by Hamilton Sundstrand, Windsor Locks CT. These aircraft are procured under the authority of the Coast Guard Aviation Program Management Office. While the base CASA CN-235-300M aircraft provides the foundation for the Coast Guard HC-144, changes to the base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M. Each HC-144 aircraft is programmed to fly 1000 hours annually.1.2 The Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) is operated differently from general aviation in support of Coast Guard Search and Rescue missions, as well as Surveillance, and Reconnaissance missions. Coast Guard HC-144 missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments. These environments accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and components of the aircraft. The aircraft and its components are inspected by Coast Guard personnel In Accordance With (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the Coast Guard's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).2. SCOPE2.1 The scope of this requirement is intended to provide and establish overhaul and repair services for the listed Hamilton Sundstrand manufactured parts (listed in the solicitation schedule). All are listed and are hereafter known as Hamilton Sundstrand components unless otherwise specified. This would include the complete teardown, inspection, repair or overhaul, assembly, and testing of all items identified in the Schedule IAW OEM specifications. This requirement establishes the minimum Coast Guard requirements necessary for overhaul and repairs, and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor detract from the procedures outlined in the manufacturer's drawings, manuals, specifications, and service bulletins. Coast Guard configuration control requires that applicable Service Bulletins and modifications for all ACMS tracked Hamilton Sundstrand components not previously configured, shall not be incorporated without prior written approval from the Coast Guard Contracting Officer.&emsp;3. REQUIREMENTS
The Small Business Contractor Shall:3.1 Be a certified Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized overhaul and repair center to effectively inspect, test, troubleshoot, clean, overhaul and repair the listed Hamilton Sundstrand components within this scope and requirements; IAW the most current Hamilton Sundstrand or other OEM Component Maintenance Manuals, revisions, temporary revisions, and specifications, including Service Bulletins, amendments, and modifications. Maintain all Coast Guard specific requirements for return to service in a Ready For Issue (RFI) condition and Coast Guard operational use. The Hamilton Sundstrand components must remain configured for installation on Coast Guard HC-144 aircraft.3.2 All 14RF-37 Propeller Blades require Blade tips to be painted White (Paint P/N 55W002) 5.75 to 6.25 inches from tip. 3.3 All 14RF-37 Propeller Hubs (814721-2) require a 100% replacement of the Outer Bearing Race (782674-1) and Race Barrel Retainers (789263-1) during Overhaul (Airworthiness Inspection). The contractor must insure that all RFI Prop Hubs (repaired or overhauled) are returned with races and retainers with matching Flight hours.3.4 The Contractor must have access to, and ability to obtain current OEM specifications for inspection, overhaul and repair of the listed Hamilton Sundstrand components. These shall include Component Maintenance Manuals (CMM), Revisions, Service Bulletins (SB), Amendments (AMD), Modifications (MOD) and drawings issued by the OEM. Contractor must have access to all updates and revisions that may be published by the OEM during the course of this contract. The Coast Guard does not own, nor can it provide this data.3.5 The Contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested. This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, personnel, documentation, preservation, shipping, etc.3.6 Designated Engineering Representative (DER) Repair Procedures3.6.1 DER Repair procedures may be authorized on a case by case basis after review and approval by the Coast Guard Engineering Officer.3.6.2 Contractor shall submit a complete technical package to the Coast Guard Contracting Officer showing the DER repair procedure on a FAA form 8110-3 which shall meet the original OEM operational requirements. This information will be treated as Procurement Sensitive and will not be released to parties outside of the Government.3.7 Levels of service:3.7.1 ""Repair"" - ""Return to Service,"" which is inspect, repair, and test as necessary. This work consists of inspection and analysis usually of a specific defective condition, repair of that condition, replacement of defective parts only as necessary, and testing to meet the OEM's functional return to service requirements. A repair does not zero the ""Time Since Overhaul"" (TSO), component time continues for repaired items. All parts sent to the Contractor under the repair level of service shall be returned to the Coast Guard within 45 calendar days After Receipt of Material (ARM) at Contractor's facility. Parts shall be returned in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition, and shipped to the Coast Guard's ALC facility unless directed otherwise by the Coast Guard Contracting Officer by contract modification.3.7.2 ""Overhaul"" - ""High Time,"" having reached one of the OEM's airworthiness limitations, any life cycle limits, or having some other general condition (out-of-limit/out-of-tolerance) such as excessive wear, tear, damage, or corrosion, as deemed to require an overhaul level of service. An ""Overhaul"" is considered over and above the ""Repair"" scope; it includes the complete teardown, inspection, rework, assembly, and testing of components, to OEM original or rebuild specifications. An overhaul zeroes the TSO and effectively restarts restoration intervals and OEM component life cycle limits as applicable. All parts sent to Contractor under the overhaul level of service must be returned to the Coast Guard within 60 calendar days After Receipt of Material (ARM) at Contractors facility. Parts shall be returned in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition, and shipped to the Coast Guard's ALC facility unless directed otherwise by the Coast Guard contracting Officer by contract modification.3.8 The Contractor shall track and document calendar time, flight time, flight/life cycles, all work and services performed on the Hamilton Sundstrand components as required under Coast Guard Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). See Section 6 for specific information.3.9 If the Contractor for any reason loses its FAA part 145 certification during the period of performance, this constitutes a material breach of contract which may, at the discretion of the Coast Guard Contracting Officer, result in contract termination. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer verbally and in writing, not later than five (5) calendar days after certification forfeiture, and disclose all facts relevant to the forfeiture.3.10 Ensure that all SBs, AMDs and MODs that have previously been incorporated remain incorporated unless otherwise appropriately superseded and directed by the Coast Guard Contracting Officer.3.11 Identify and recommend, new or additional SBs, AMDs, or MODs, as applicable, to be incorporated and specify how the SBs, AMDs, or MODs may affect components, part numbers, and pricing.3.12 Provide current lists and status of all Hamilton Sundstrand or other OEM Manuals, Component Maintenance Manuals (CMM), Revisions (Rev), Temporary Revisions (TR), Service Bulletins (SB), Modifications (MOD), Amendments (AMD), including Contractor specifications and procedures applicable, and to be used for the inspection, repairs or overhaul of the listed Coast Guard Hamilton Sundstrand components. 3.12.1 The list/lists may be provided in the Contractors' style and format but must contain the following information:&#61607; Name/Nomenclature and type of document&#61607; Part numbers as applicable&#61607; Air Transport Association (ATA) Chapter Code&#61607; Basic / Issue dates&#61607; Revision or TR numbers and dates&#61607; OEM and applicable cage code3.13 Provide current Capabilities list, REF: FAA part 145.2153.14 If the Contractor receives information more current than that previously provided to the Coast Guard, the Contractor must identify the Hamilton Sundstrand or other OEM Manuals, CMMs, Revisions, and specifications, including Service Bulletins, Amendments, and Modifications, and provide a brief synopsis of the revisions and dates to the Coast Guard's Contracting Officer for review and disposition approval. Refer to paragraph 3.17 for the incorporation of Service Bulletins and modifications.3.15 Environmental Requirements 3.15.1 All parts must be thoroughly cleaned IAW applicable Component Maintenance Manuals or FAA Advisory Circular 43-205, Guidance for Selecting Chemical Agents and Processes for Depainting and General Cleaning of Aircraft and Aviation Products, to ensure they are as free as practicable of all hazardous dust to include hexavalent chromium, cadmium, lead, etc., prior to being returned to ALC. ALC may take random samples of parts to ensure they are free as practicable of all hazards. Information on these hazards can be found in Occupational Safety and Health Standards 1910.1025 (lead), 1910.1026 (Hexavalent Chromium) and 1910.1027 (Cadmium)3.16 Provide written delivery order receipts within 5 working days for all Hamilton Sundstrand components.3.16.1 Delivery order receipts shall include, but are not limited to, the following information: nomenclature, National Stock Numbers (NSN), P/Ns, S/Ns, contract number, delivery order numbers, Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN), and dates of receipt.3.16.2 Delivery order receipts via facsimile/email are acceptable and may contain single or multiple notification entries.3.17 To maintain all Service Bulletins (Mandatory and Optional) and other modifications previously incorporated unless otherwise directed by the Coast Guard Contracting Officer.3.17.1 Service bulletin configurations are subject to change during the course of the contract period. Service Bulletins and modifications not previously incorporated shall be identified for Coast Guard Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall obtain and notify the Coast Guard Contracting Officer of service bulletin changes and modifications, for disposition approval prior to incorporation of those changes and modifications3.17.2 Service bulletins incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configurations. In cases where the older configurations cannot be modified to the newer configurations, the new configuration part numbers may be added to the contract. The Contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Coast Guard Contracting Officer for superseded parts, which have been removed and replaced by newer configurations.3.17.3 Upon receipt of notification and authorization from the Coast Guard Contracting Officer that a service bulletin or modification is to be incorporated, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of that notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for the service bulletin to be incorporated in the component. The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups. Upon completion of negotiations, a contract modification will be issued to reflect this change, and the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the Contractor's facility for which the service bulletin has not already been incorporated. When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract. The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required. Failure to supply a change notice shall forfeit the right to any increase as a result of the contractor's failure to request a price change. Unless the contractor has a signed contract modification permitting a change and bearing the signature of a Coast Guard Contracting Officer, funding has not been authorized. Performance without written authority from the Coast Guard Contracting Officer will not be authorized for payment.3.18 Prepare and submit, component Teardown Inspection Reports (TIR)3.18.1 TIRs, are occasionally requested by the Coast Guard Contracting Officer, and are usually requested in support of a Coast Guard Engineering incident, safety investigation, warranty determination, or for other failure analysis.3.18.2 Upon request the Contractor shall within ten calendar days provide a copy of the TIR to the Contracting Officer. TIRs, when requested, shall be forwarded to the Coast Guard Contracting Officer prior to commencement of repair or overhaul work.3.18.3 TIRs shall include: nomenclature, NSNs, P/Ns, S/Ns, Contract number, Delivery Order numbers, CLINs, including descriptions, photos, illustrations, and drawings, as necessary before and during teardown, for documentation of the failure, and list all parts and costs as would be required for repair/overhaul of the component or assembly.3.19 Replacement Parts:3.19.1 Contractor is responsible for all replacement parts required for repairs/overhauls, with the exception of high time, life, or cycle limited parts.3.19.2 Coast Guard Life and cycle limited components shall be deemed at life limit if the component has 2% or less hours or cycles remaining until the published airworthiness limit is reached.3.19.3 High time, life, or cycle limited parts which have reached their respective limits IAW paragraph 3.19.2 above, shall not be repaired or overhauled, but shall be replaced with other Coast Guard serviceable parts or replaced with new OEM parts. The cost to replace high time, life, or cycle limited parts shall be priced separately and not included in the cost of overhauled components under this contract. High time, life or cycle limited parts will be negotiated on a case by case basis.3.19.4 Replacement parts shall be new and have full traceability to the OEM, Hamilton Sundstrand. See Paragraph 3.19.5 concerning PMA parts (Parts Manufacturer Approval).3.19.5 Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA)3.19.5.1 PMA parts may be authorized on a case by case basis after review of technical documentation and approval by Coast Guard Engineering Officer.3.19.5.2 The contractor shall submit a complete technical package to the Coast Guard contracting officer showing that the PMA part meets or exceeds the original OEM specifications. This information will be treated as proprietary information; the Coast Guard will not release this information to other sources outside of the Government.3.19.6 Defective parts: The cost of repair or replacement of defective parts is inclusive to the component repair contract price. Defective parts which cannot otherwise be repaired IAW OEM specifications, shall be scrapped IAW ALCINST 4100.1 dated 15 August 2008, and replaced with new OEM parts (See Paragraph 3.19.5 concerning PMA parts).3.20 Beyond Economical Repair (BER):3.20.1 When the cost of returning the contract line item (CLIN) part to serviceable condition, exceeds the current replacement cost of that part; or when the part cannot be repaired or overhauled due to damage or wear beyond the material properties, characteristic, or specifications of the item. The Contractor shall contact the Coast Guard Contracting Officer, in writing, via FAX or e-mail, with specific rationale for the BER condition. The rationale shall include and provide: nomenclature, NSN, P/N, S/N, contract number, delivery order number, and CLIN along with a cost breakdown of additional parts and labor as would be necessary to actually repair the component to serviceable status. Refer to paragraph 3.20.3 for further disposition and rationale.3.20.2 If the contract line item (received at the Contractor's facility) is later determined to be in a BER condition. The Coast Guard Contracting Officer must be notified immediately following the BER determination and provide rational. Refer to paragraph 3.20.3 for further disposition and rationale.3.20.3 Once the contract line item is determined to be BER, no further repair/overhaul work on that item will be performed and the item in question will be placed in a bonded storage room for safekeeping until written authorization to proceed or other disposition instructions are received from the Coast Guard Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer's disposition iinstructions will request,  if applicable, a fixed price proposal for teardown, evaluation, including the number of labor hours and labor rates from the Contractor.  Contractor shall not repair, scrap, or return material until disposition instructions have been provided by the USCG Contracting Officer.
