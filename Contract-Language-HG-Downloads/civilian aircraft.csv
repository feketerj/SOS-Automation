This is an update to the previously posted RFI No. FD2060-24-31084, which included the UALS and the 20MM Ammunition-Transfer System (ATS) Replenisher. This RFI removes the ATS Replenisher Requirement and updates the assigned NAICS from 332993 - Ammunition (except Small Arms) to a more appropriate NAICS 336413 &ndash; Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing to ensure that the proper industry base is notified.

The purpose of this requirement is to gain a fleet-wide replacement of all 20mm ammunition loaders; the fleet is currently at 529. The UALS has been used in conjunction with the M61A1/A2 20MM Gatling Gun on F-15, F-16, and F-22 platforms since 1986. The UALS is a military unique support equipment item. There are no commercial ammunition loaders in the current civilian aircraft fleets. Only military aircraft are allowed to fire on enemy targets with 20MM ammunition. The Universal Ammunition Loading System (UALS) has the NSN: 1730-01-200-2301RN, and part number: 212F156.
