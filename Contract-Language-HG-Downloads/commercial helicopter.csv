(BHTI), Fort Worth, TX for the procurement of the following items: Up to an additional ten (10) Bell 407 variant commercial helicopters, associated Bell 407 unique components, support equipment,  preservation and storage, and engineering support through FY 2021. These contract efforts are in support of the Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) requirements under the MQ-8C Fire Scout Unmanned Air System (UAS) Program of Record (POR) with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) which authorizes a quantity up to forty (40) MQ-8C Fire Scout Air Vehicles through FY 2022. 
The proposed contract action(s) are those for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, ""Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.""

65ecd47e012fa7a41442af3401bd8007,FA852417R0029,Manufacture of Pinion Assembly for UH-1N Helicopter," 
The Government is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet qualification requirements to manufacture the
Pinion Assembly, P/N 204-040-102-17, NSN 1615-00-898-1689, Applicable to the UH-1N Helicopter
 
This required in order to support the UH-1N.  The UH-1N is a light-lift utility helicopter used to support various missions. The primary missions include: airlift of emergency security forces, security and surveillance of off-base nuclear weapons convoys, and distinguished visitor airlift. Other uses include: disaster response operations, search and rescue, medical evacuation, airborne cable inspections, support to aircrew survival school, aerial testing, routine missile site support and transport.  The UH-1N is part of the presidential aerial support, along with supporting the Special Operation Forces (SOF)/Search and Rescue Personnel Recovery missions. 
 
The UH-1N is a utility helicopter that is used by the Air Force for missile site surveillance, nuclear convoy protection and Special Operation Forces (SOF)/Search and Rescue Personnel Recovery missions.  Others are mission critical as they allow the student pilots to train using these devices
 
The Pinion Assembly is currently supporting the UH-1N platforms.  This item was designed by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (BHT) for use on their 212 commercial helicopter, as well as the military UH-1N.  
 
Assembly - Pinion (gear) is located on the transmission generator drive quill assembly.  The transmission provides a drive angle change and speed reduction from the engine to the main rotor. This is accomplished through spiral bevel gears and two stage planetary gears. Secondary gear trains drive the tail rotor driveshaft, transmission oil pump, tachometer generator, two hydraulic pumps and the rotor brake drive quill  The transmission main input quill incorporates a one way clutch which permits the transmission and the components that it drives to overrun the engine and main driveshaft. This provides for a free drive system for autorotation.  The transmission oil system is self-contained with the exception that an external oil cooler is required.
 
The Pinion Assembly has of an Acquisition Method (AMC) / Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMSC) of 3/R.  AMC 3: Acquire, for the second or subsequent time, directly for the actual manufacturer.  AMSC R:  The government does not own the data or rights to the data needed to purchase this part from additional sources. It has been determined to be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the data. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer the part. This code is used when the government did not initially purchase the data and/or rights.
