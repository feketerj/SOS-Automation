The proximity to a large salt-water body accelerates corrosion of SDAVs at Keesler. Therefore, it is vital to ensure funding is secured to mitigate existing corrosion and restore the aircraft as a means to develop a resilient barrier to preserve historical artifacts. Without funding to refurbish and restore the SDAVs at Keesler Air Force base, the USAF could lose artifacts which served as trainers to prepare many USAF pilots for service and Vietnam War memorials.

All repair work shallbe performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any othercontractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures.CAGE___Ref.

Old part cannot replace new.Code 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable.3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in thespecification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements.4.2   Inspection/Testing Repaired Items - The Contractor shall perform all inspection and testing requirements as specified in the original manufacturer's specifications and drawings.4.3   Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies.5.

REQUIREMENTS3.1   Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The ELECTRONIC COMPONEN  repaired under this contract/purchase order shall meet the operational and functional requirements as represented by the Cage Code(s) and reference number(s) listed below. All repair work shallbe performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any othercontractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures.CAGE___Ref. No.;52088       A004340;3.2   Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordancewith ;MIL-STD-129; .3.3   Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified andapproval has been given by issuance of a written change order.  When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for thesubstituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor.  If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Governmentevaluation.  When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements:Code 1:  PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number.Code 2:  Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts.Code 3:  Part not furnished separately - Use assembly.Code 4:  Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable.Code 5:  Part redesigned - New part replaces old.  Old part cannot replace new.Code 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable.3.4   Electrostatic Discharge Control - The Contractor shall comply with the electrostatic discharge control requirements established in MIL-STD-1686.3.5   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.4.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS - NOT APPLICABLE3.  REQUIREMENTS3.1 Welding and welder qualifications shall be in accordance with AWS D1.1for steel, AWS D1.2 or MIL-W-22248,Class 4 for aluminum, AWS D1.3for sheet steel and AWS D1.6 for stainless steel. Proper controls shall be used to prevent melt through or burn through. For aluminum, filler for welding 6061 alloy shall be 4043: filler for welding 5000 series alloysto themselves or to 6061 shall be 5356 or 5556. In addition,welding andweld inspection shall include:(1) Visual inspection shall include 5X (5power) magnification when a suspectcondition is to be examined beyond the capability of normal vision.(2) Critical and major welds may be subjected to further non destructivetesting (such as dye penetrant inspection)as prescribed by the buying         activity.(3) Proper documentation shall be available for review by Government personnel.3.2  WORK INSTRUCTIONS.  Work instructions shall be posted at theoperator's  work station giving procedures to control the welding process,   i.e., filler material, weld size, electrical and gas characteristics,      including flow rate.3.3  MATERIALS AND MATERIALS CONTROL.  The quality program shall assure that the materials used in fabrication or processing, i.e., base metals and weld filler material, be inspected and conform to the applicable physical, chemical and other technicalrequirements (supplier's certification is sufficient).3.4  CONTROLS.  Weld filler materials shall be clearly identified and segregated from each other both when in storage and at the work station.  Work station environment shall be controlled to prevent conditions adverse to proper gas shielding.3.5 CLEANING.  Parts to be welded shall be cleaned to remove surface soils such as oils, waxes, grease, inks, etc. except that uninhibited  alkaline solutions such as sodium hydroxide shall NOT be used.3.6 DEOXIDIZING.  The cleaned parts shall be chemically deoxidized NO MORE THAN 10 DAYS PRIOR TO WELDING to remove thick surface oxide films. (If the material or work is exposed to an outdoor environment, this time limit shall be reduced to a maximum of 3 days,to account for atmospheric effects.)  Mechanical cleaning methods shall be applied just prior to the actual start of welding, to remove any reoxidation or residual thin oxide films.3.6.1  CHEMICAL TREATMENT.  An acid deoxidizing treatment shall be applied  by either immersion or brushing/wiping.  Deoxidizers acceptable for use shall include nitric acid, sulfuric chromic, phosphoric chromic, or equivalent solutions.  Sodium hydroxidesolutions shall not be used.  Care shall be taken to assure 100% solution coverage of the area to be welded.  To allow an adequately sized deoxidized area for good welding, the solution shall be applied to an area extending at least 2 inches from the weld site,or ending at any closer adjacent edge.3.6.2  MECHANICAL MEANS.  Immediately prior to welding, mechanical cleaning methods shall be applied to the weld areas previously chemically treated to assure removal of residual or reformed oxides, if any.  Acceptable methods of mechanical cleaning includestainless steel wire brushing, scraping, filing, or sanding. However, abrasives containing iron and its oxides, steel wool and wire, and copper alloy based wire, which may become embedded with galvanically active metals and accelerate corrosion of aluminumalloys shall NOT be used.  Mechanical methods shall be vigorous enough to adequately remove any residual oxide films, but gentle enough to avoid forming an excessively rough surface  in the comparatively soft metal underneath.4.

Thesespares are non-CLSSA FMS assets and will never be delivered toDoD. The assets are delivered to a domestic U.S. freight forwarderwho is under contract by the FMS customer to ship the assets tothe country of record.The FMS customer countries retain ownership of their parts throughoutthe asset's lifecycle. These parts will never be owned by the U.S.Government, and will never be entered into the DoD supply chain.Based on this, there is no need for these non-CLSSA FMS country assetsto be specially marked for tracking by DoD.\",DLA Aviation,2025-06-03 10:48:59.430000+00:00,2025-06-03,2025-06-13 20:30:00+00:00,2025-06-13,America/New_York,Solicitation,,336413,Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing ,6340,Aircraft Alarm and Signal Systems,,Telephone: 2157372488,SAMUEL.EVERETT@DLA.MIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,97AS,SPRPA1,"DLA AVIATION AT PHILADELPHIA, PA",ad808ee9002048d3bedb9f4c173eaefe,SAMUEL.EVERETT@DLA.MIL,SAMUEL.EVERETT@DLA.MIL,2025-06-29 04:19:49.329000+00:00,2025-06-03 10:48:59.376000+00:00,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/SPRPA125QEC41-Solicitation-eaefe,https://sam.gov/opp/ad808ee9002048d3bedb9f4c173eaefe/view

The assets are delivered to a     domestic U.S. freight forwarderwho is under contract by the FMS customer to  ship the assets to the country of record.The FMS customer countries retain ownership of their parts throughout the     asset's lifecycle. These parts will never be owned by the U.S. Government, and will never be entered into the DoD supply chain. Based on this, there is no need for these non-CLSSA FMScountry assets to be specially marked for tracking by DoD.\",DLA Aviation,2025-05-23 11:52:33.077000+00:00,2025-05-23,2025-06-02 20:30:00+00:00,2025-06-02,America/New_York,Solicitation,,336413,Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing ,1680,Miscellaneous Aircraft Accessories and Components,,Telephone: 2157372612,NIKOLIN.TOROVECI@DLA.MIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,97AS,SPRPA1,"DLA AVIATION AT PHILADELPHIA, PA",ddab603536ad45148e356be46b7f427b,NIKOLIN.TOROVECI@DLA.MIL,NIKOLIN.TOROVECI@DLA.MIL,2025-06-18 03:55:46.303000+00:00,2025-05-23 11:52:33.016000+00:00,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/SPRPA125QEL59-Solicitation-f427b,https://sam.gov/opp/66514da15e63476abe1f76baf6be3beb/view

Thesespares are non-CLSSA FMS assets and will never be delivered toDoD. The assets are delivered to a domestic U.S. freight forwarderwho is under contract by the FMS customer to ship the assets tothe country of record.The FMS customer countries retain ownership of their parts throughoutthe asset's lifecycle. These parts will never be owned by the U.S.Government, and will never be entered into the DoD supply chain.Based on this, there is no need for these non-CLSSA FMS country assetsto be specially marked for tracking by DoD.\",DLA Aviation,2025-04-22 12:17:31.661000+00:00,2025-04-22,2025-05-02 20:30:00+00:00,2025-05-02,America/New_York,Solicitation,,334511,"Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing ",6605,Navigational Instruments,,Telephone: 2157372488,SAMUEL.EVERETT@DLA.MIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,97AS,SPRPA1,"DLA AVIATION AT PHILADELPHIA, PA",a1c4ca67a16c4316b1048f3df30bd982,SAMUEL.EVERETT@DLA.MIL,SAMUEL.EVERETT@DLA.MIL,2025-05-18 04:00:14.936000+00:00,2025-04-22 12:17:31.616000+00:00,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/SPRPA125QEB86-Solicitation-bd982,https://sam.gov/opp/a1c4ca67a16c4316b1048f3df30bd982/view

Issue Date: 06 February 2023 &ndash; Closing Date: 21 February 2023 &ndash; Time Eastern

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement for new manufacture, evaluation, and repair of the AN/SPQ-9B Bull Gear Bearing.

The proposed contract action is for the new manufacture, evaluation, and repair of the bull gear bearings for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Kaydon Corporation, Muskegon, Michigan, 49441 CAGE 32828.

This effort is anticipated to be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). The basis for restricting competition is the anticipated duplication of costs to the Government to qualify another manufacturer&rsquo;s product for shipboard use, which are not anticipated to be recouped through competition, and the anticipated unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements through any other source.

This is being sole sourced due to Kaydon having proprietary rights to the detailed drawings, repair procedures, and testing procedures needed to evaluate, refurbish, and manufacture the bearing. Without these documents, no other vendor could evaluate or refurbish the bearing without significant duplication of cost to reverse engineer the bearing to develop the technical data needed.

The Government intends to solicit and award a single Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite- Delivery, Indefinite- Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five (5) year ordering period. The anticipated contract award maximum is estimated to be $1,325,324.42. A solicitation will NOT be posted to sam.gov due to the sole source nature of the requirement.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the controlled attachments. Offers may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the internet at https://sam.gov/content/home. Information about the JCP is located at https://www.dla.mil/Logistics-Operations/Services/JCP/.

All changes that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to contract Opportunities on https://sam.gov/content/home.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project will be for the 100% Design of the renovation for B500 which is located on Offutt AFB, NE. B500 is a 652,000 square feet building which includes multiple underground levels and three above ground floors.  A 35% concept design is being completed under a separate task order. This project will include the completion of that design and options for construction phase services. The building and its infrastructure have aged over its 75-year life span. While multiple iterations of technology and interior upgrades have taken place, the facility has never undergone the kind of whole-sale refurbishment planned in this contract. The building provides both secure and unsecure space for various DoD tenants, some completely unassociated with others. Phasing plans for the construction will likely be a major consideration during design and may require temporary swing space to include temporary secure swing space. Natural daylight and other modern architectural and interior design considerations were not included in the buildings original construction but will be desired as part of this project. Significant floor-plan changes are required to address DOD tenant requirements. Modernization includes any and all mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and build controls systems typically employed in a modern, secure DoD administrative facility. In addition to housing a variety of tenants, the building will also include a permanent, purpose made command section for a USAF Wing Level Command suite and associated functions. The project may include partial demolition of the facility for what may be considered surplus square footage. Creative use of existing open air courtyards in the interior of the building are encouraged, including in-fill, where appropriate, to address challenges to the existing constraints of structure, floorplan, and other building features. An existing conditions building plan is required and will be used for the completion of the design.  Facility will be designed as permanent construction in accordance with Department of Defense   Unified Facilities Criteria 1-200-01. This project will comply with Department of Defense antiterrorism/force protection requirements per Unified Facilities Criteria 4-010-01.

REQUIREMENTS3.1 Welding and welder qualifications shall be in accordance with AWS D1.1for steel, AWS D1.2 or MIL-W-22248,Class 4 for aluminum, AWS D1.3for sheet steel and AWS D1.6 for stainless steel. Proper controls shall be used to prevent melt through or burn through. For aluminum, filler for welding 6061 alloy shall be 4043: filler for welding 5000 series alloysto themselves or to 6061 shall be 5356 or 5556. In addition,welding andweld inspection shall include:(1) Visual inspection shall include 5X (5power) magnification when a suspectcondition is to be examined beyond the capability of normal vision.(2) Critical and major welds may be subjected to further non destructivetesting (such as dye penetrant inspection)as prescribed by the buying         activity.(3) Proper documentation shall be available for review by Government personnel.3.2  WORK INSTRUCTIONS.  Work instructions shall be posted at theoperator's  work station giving procedures to control the welding process,   i.e., filler material, weld size, electrical and gas characteristics,      including flow rate.3.3  MATERIALS AND MATERIALS CONTROL.  The quality program shall assure that the materials used in fabrication or processing, i.e., base metals and weld filler material, be inspected and conform to the applicable physical, chemical and other technicalrequirements (supplier's certification is sufficient).3.4  CONTROLS.  Weld filler materials shall be clearly identified and segregated from each other both when in storage and at the work station.  Work station environment shall be controlled to prevent conditions adverse to proper gas shielding.3.5 CLEANING.  Parts to be welded shall be cleaned to remove surface soils such as oils, waxes, grease, inks, etc. except that uninhibited  alkaline solutions such as sodium hydroxide shall NOT be used.3.6 DEOXIDIZING.  The cleaned parts shall be chemically deoxidized NO MORE THAN 10 DAYS PRIOR TO WELDING to remove thick surface oxide films. (If the material or work is exposed to an outdoor environment, this time limit shall be reduced to a maximum of 3 days,to account for atmospheric effects.)  Mechanical cleaning methods shall be applied just prior to the actual start of welding, to remove any reoxidation or residual thin oxide films.3.6.1  CHEMICAL TREATMENT.  An acid deoxidizing treatment shall be applied  by either immersion or brushing/wiping.  Deoxidizers acceptable for use shall include nitric acid, sulfuric chromic, phosphoric chromic, or equivalent solutions.  Sodium hydroxidesolutions shall not be used.

I. DESCRIPTION

A. AN/TPY-2 Description:

The Missile Defense Agency&rsquo;s Ground Sensors Directorate (MDA/SN) is conducting market research to determine industry interest and capability to support future requirements for its Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control Model-2 (AN/TPY-2).

The requirements include hardware and software development development (to include radar modeling and simulation); production of components, spares, fleet refurbishment, and capability upgrades; and operations and sustainment of AN/TPY-2 radars. Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) may address all or part of these requirements.  The Government invites industry to provide feedback on contracting strategy for the requirements to include combination of requirements, contract type, and areas that would be accomplished well through small business set aside versus full and open competition.



This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes &ndash; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the government to establish a contract for any of the requirements.  Further, MDA is not seeking proposal nor will it accept proposals.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent&rsquo;s expense.  Participation in future Agency transactions and procurement opportunities is not contingent on responding to this RFI.  MDA will not provide feedback for any submission.

7. Modeling and Simulation


	Systems engineering, development, maintenance, test, verification and validation of real-time and non-real-time digital end-to-end radar models and real-time HWIL radar driver for AN/TPY-2.
	Digital radar models and HWIL driver should accurately simulate and/or stimulate tactical AN/TPY-2, while maintaining the fidelity of complex radar scenes presented to the model and simulation. Complex radar scenes typically include simple and advanced threats comprised of multiple objects and scatterers, and the effects as they propagate through an air picture. The air picture captures weather, environmental, and other effects. Examples include but are not limited to precipitation, sky noise, tropospheric effects, and intercept debris. Complex radar scenes may also incorporate electronic attack.
	Model development, verification, validation, and accreditation must support tactical development, test and fielding in accordance with the MDA Phased Implementation Plan and Integrated Master Test Plan.
	HWIL radar drivers, aligned to tactical radar capabilities, are required for development and testing of the radar software, and are required early in the radar software development timeline due to increasingly complex radar capabilities. Therefore, HWIL radar drivers must be developed as part of the agile radar development cycle to more closely coordinate with radar development efforts, and must be integrated with the HWIL radar representation as part of the development cycle.
	Due to increasing stakeholder needs for digital radar models early in the radar software development cycle, digital radar models, with capabilities aligned to tactical radar software releases, are required along the same timeline as radar software releases, to include radar software engineering releases and formal releases. Therefore, digital end-to-end radar models should utilize Wrapped Tactical Code (WTC) methodology, as applicable, using radar software source code with appropriate interfaces to operate in both real-time and non-real-time as either standalone models or as part of integrated system simulations such as End-to-End Digital Integrated System Simulation (EDISS).
	Models and simulations should implement tactical messages and interfaces that integrate into interoperable frameworks such as the OSF for Ground Test Integrated System Simulation (GTISS) and EDISS.
	Integration of digital radar models and HWIL radar drivers with simulation frameworks such as the OSF for GTISS and EDISS.
	Maintenance and test of COTS hardware used by digital radar models and HWIL radar drivers to ensure models meet cybersecurity and performance requirements needed to satisfy intended use cases.
	Development and maintenance of current applicable cybersecurity documentation for each radar model in order to support Risk Management Framework (RMF) authorization. Implement applicable cybersecurity requirements and solutions into System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
	Development of RMF package and support cybersecurity and Software Assurance (SwA) requirements and activities for each radar model. Provide RMF continuous monitoring.
	Development and maintenance of radar model training materials. Conduct as needed, hands-on training to end-users and stakeholders.
	Support for use of models and simulations in events, including but not limited to the following:
	
		Performance Assessment

3b93cc97c5024878a7840985c779550e,,Synopsis for Aviation Ground Power Unit 1.1 Production Contract,"This notice is provided for informational purposes only and is not a request for proposals. The Army Contracting Command &ndash; Redstone Arsenal proposed to acquire Aviation Ground Power Unit (AGPU) 1.1 and ancillary services, parts, training and refurbishment. It will be awarded on an other than full and open competitive basis under the authority of Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements; Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. .

The proposed contract action is a sixty-month production indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract. This effort includes Field Support Packages (FSP), test equipment, and New Equipment Training, Authorized Stockage List, Initial Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS), and Engineering Support Services (ESS) efforts, as well as refurbishment of test articles. The AGPU 1.1 provides the electricity, pneumatic, and hydraulic capabilities that maintenance personnel use to service, maintain and preflight Army Aviation rotary wing aircraft. Actual quantities will be dependent upon the needs of the customers and fiscal constraints.

The proposed acquisition is limited to Sun Test Systems (Sun Test), 2903 Wall Triana Highway, Huntsville, AL, 35824; CAGE 9HAF9.

As the prime contractor of AGPU 1.1s on the current Other Transaction Authority, Sun Test is the only source that provides a three-in-one unit that includes electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic pressure and flow to rotary wing platforms during ground maintenance. Going with another contractor would cause significant duplication of costs to the USG that could not be recovered through competition.

Interested parties should identify themselves in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer.

Purpose: This notice satisfies the requirement to synopsize the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Project Shanyrak contract action in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.201(a) and (b)(1)(i) as well as represents the pre-solicitation notice IAW FAR 5.204.  It also represents the Government&rsquo;s notice of intent to execute this requirement without competition on a sole-source basis to NNC.  It has been posted to the Governmentwide Point of Entry (www.sam.gov) IAW FAR 5.201(b)(1).  This notice does not constitute the solicitation; the Government intends to issue this contract without providing for full and open competition.  Specifically, the Government has determined the only one responsible source to fulfill these requirements is NNC (Cage Code: SG831) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  As such, this is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals.



Scope Description:  Since 1993, DTRA has partnered with the NNC (also known as the RESPUBLIKANSKOE GOSUDARSTVENNOE PREDPRIYATIE NA PRAVE KHOZYAISTVENNOGO VEDENIYA NATSIONALNYI YADERNYI TSENTR RESPUBLIKI KAZAKHSTAN MINISTERSTVA ENERGETIKI RESPUBLIKI KAZAKHSTAN), a Kazakhstani (state-owned) entity, to conduct nuclear material and nuclear testing infrastructure surveys, material characterization, removal, security, elimination and/or disposition; physical and technical protection and security systems refurbishments and improvements; and related sustainment to maintain a variety of NNC and DTRA investments to date at Kazakhstan&rsquo;s Semipalatinsk Test Site (STS).  Prior efforts, as outlined below, have all been executed on a sole-source basis through various contract vehicles, with supporting Justification and Approvals (J&amp;A) or equivalents IAW FAR 6.302-1.

Project Shanyrak is a follow-on to Project Minuteman (HDTRA120C0075), awarded on 30 September 2020 and expires on 30 September 2025; however, the majority of the work planned for Project Minuteman is either complete or near complete.  Some tasks originally planned for Project Minuteman that could not be completed on schedule for a variety of reasons have been de-scoped with the intent of placing them on Project Shanyrak.   Prior to Project Minuteman, DTRA awarded contracts between 2008 and 2020 under a basic order agreement (BOA) (HDTRA108G0001 with NNC, used for five orders, 0001-0005). The BOA succeeded contracts DNA001-95-C-0179, DNA001-96-C-0099, DSWA01-97-C-0027, DSWA01-98-C-0016, HDTRA1-05-C-0036, and HDTRA1-06-C-0047 with DTRA and its predecessor organizations.

Under Project Shanyrak, the NNC will perform labor involving the survey, characterization, and where necessary, remediation and security, of identified nuclear material and related infrastructure. Efforts will also include sustainment of prior DTRA investments in physical and technical security and response functions across STS. Program objectives include ensuring all known nuclear material is secured and related infrastructure at the Semipalatinsk Test Site (STS) is eliminated, and Kazakhstan remains postured to surveil and monitor strategic sites and sustain investments provided by the U.S. Government under previous contracts with NNC.  NNC&#39;s work will ensure long-term security of nuclear materials at STS in support of the Global Nuclear Security (GNS) program, Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR), DTRA and U.S. Government (USG) mission objectives and strategic guidance.

All subject work will be performed within the NNC&rsquo;s jurisdiction in Kurchatov, Kazakhstan, at STS itself, or in other localities where meetings and activities outside of Kurchatov and STS directly support implementation activities. 

  

Sole Source Justification:  The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Department of Defense need not provide for full and open competition when only one or a limited number of responsible sources are available and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

NNC is the only acceptable and capable performer for this work because Kazakhstan tightly restricts operations at STS through several national-level documents, to include formal Presidential Decree No. 1002, the statutory vehicle with most supremacy in Kazakhstan, dated August 13, 1996.  This decree and other national-level documents effectively mean that the Government of Kazakhstan will not permit or sanction any labor-related implementation at STS by any entity other than NNC, which severely restricts DTRA&rsquo;s acquisition alternatives to meet its mission objectives.  The NNC has full access to the STS and is specifically authorized by its government to enter into contracts, to include those with foreign governments, for this type of work. 

Within 14 days after contract award, the Government intends to post the J&amp;A for Project Shanyrak on www.sam.gov in accordance with FAR 6.305(a) and the J&amp;A will remain posted for at least 30 days.  Prior to posting, the Government will ensure all sensitive and proprietary data has been redacted.

The Source Approval Request shall contain the following documentation and shall be submitted by the closing date of this solicitation:(A)  Copy of complete configuration drawings for a similar item(s) which your company has produced within the past three years, including test procedures for which your company (1) has been qualified to manufacture and (2) which is similar, i.e., requires thesame materials, manufacturing processes, inspections, tolerances and similar application as the item(s) for which you are seeking approval.(B)  Copy of the complete process/operation sheets used to manufacuture the similar item, including but not limited to, detailed shop sketches.  These plans must note those operations and processes performed by subcontractors/ vendors.(C)  Complete copies of purchase orders, shipping documents, etc. that document delivery of production quantities of the part to the Original Equipment Manufacturer or Military service.  Provide the most recent copies of the documents.(D)  A detailed comparative analysis of the differences/similarities between the similar part and the part(s) for which you are seeking approval.  This analysis should include materials, configuration, tolerances, process requirements, dimensions, castings,forgings, etc.(E)  Copy of inspection method sheets used in the manufacturing and at final inspection.  These sheets should include actual tolerance, print requirements, inspection devices, sources performing the operation and level of inspection. Critical characteristicsshould be discernible from all other characteristics.The above requirements are a subset of requirements specified in the ASOSource Approval Information Brochure dated January 1995.  The submission of this data subset is contingent upon and in consideration of the submitting contractor meeting all other requirements specified in this solicitation to include a bilateral agreement withMDA which includes availability of complete data, MRB disposition, etc.  Any company not having such agreement, but desiring to seek engineering source approval, will be required to submit data meeting all requirements of the ASO/NAVICP Source ApprovalBrochure.1.4 Sampling rates (AQLs) indicated below shall be used in accordance withANSI Z1.4 for Single Sampling and a General Inspection Level of II.1.5 In addition to the 100% PCO Mandatory, critical and major characteristics,attributes for plating, hardness and non-destructive testing will be inspectedone hundred percent.1.6 Contractor shall develop a system for identification of individualpiece parts for traceability purposes. Markings shall not be permanent.1.7 An AQL of 1.5 will be used for Class 3 threads and dimensions, andgeometric feature controls with a tolerance range of .010 or less.1.8 For minor characteristics, a sampling rate determined by the contractorand subject to QAR approval will be used.1.9 The material covered in this contract/purchase order will be used in acrucial shipboard system enabling the launch and/or recovery of aircraft. The use of incorrect or defective material would create a high probability of failure resulting in a serious personnel injury, loss of life, loss of vitalshipboard systems or loss of aircraft.

The implementation team for this project shall consist of three lead members: Project Manager (PM), Implementation Engineer (IE) Anesthesiology Service Chief or clinical designee.

Anesthesiology Setup Design 
Anesthesiology will conduct a clinical design workshop for each care unit included in the scope of this project.   
The Anesthesiology Department will meet with key stakeholders and unit members to define current unit workflows (clinical workflow analysis) and recommend opportunities for improvement leveraging the solution.
The clinical workflow analysis is an onsite evaluation of each unit s current workflow, including communication and/or alarm systems. It is performed by Anesthesiology staff in collaboration with patient areas. The Anesthesiology staff will round on each of the units deploying the Vocera solution.  The unit evaluation will include testing the current system, observing staff performance of various tasks to identify gaps or breaks in communication.   
The clinical workflow analysis should be scheduled for up to one hour per nursing unit.
Government Point of Contact Service Chief or clinical designee will serve as clinical escort for each nursing unit during the clinical workflow analysis.
The deliverable from this process will be the clinical design workbook document summarizing the clinical discovery data gathered from the customer team along with the diagrams depicting the enhanced clinical workflows.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The ACCELEROMETER ELECT repaired under this contract/purchase order shall meet the operational and functional requirements as represented by the Cage Code(s) and reference number(s) listed below. All repair work shall be performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any other contractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures. CAGE___Ref. No. ;52088 1003196-1; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order. When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer&#39;s Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor&#39;s request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a &quot;Warning Plate&quot; stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.
