The delivery orders will procure Structural Improvement and Electrical Power Upgrades (SIEPU) Kits and Installation as well as Combining Gear Box (C-Box) Rotable Pool assets in support of the U.S. Marine Corps H-1 Helicopter Program to include the AH-1Z and UH-1Y T/M/S aircraft. Efforts under the resultant orders will include the procurement of SIEPU Phase 3.0 recurring engineering that integrates the SIEPU design developed under previous SIEPU Phases on AH-1Z and UH-1Y T/M/S aircraft. SIEPU Phase 3.0 includes procurement of approximately (108) A-kits, (108) B-Kits, (24) Hoist Mission Kits, (48) Fast Rope Gantry Mission Kits, (96) Aircraft Restraint System Mission Kits, (48) Ammunition Can Mission Kits, initial spares, tooling and installation. Additionally, (247) Rotorcraft Station Control Units (RSCU), (234) AC Generators, (234) Generator Control Units (GCU), (936) Tube Assemblies, and (132) upgraded C-Boxes, will be procured as time critical parts for SIEPU 3.0. These efforts also include Program Management, Logistics Management, Configuration Management, Engineering, and financial/technical/administrative reporting. The SIEPU 3.0 recurring kits and install effort will include a base year and four (4) option periods, and is planned to be awarded in the 1st quarter of FY25. The SIEPU 3.0 time critical parts and C-Box effort will include a base and 4 option periods, and is planned to be awarded in FY26.



This requirement will be procured in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under 10 U.S.C.3204(a)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. Although the Government possesses unlimited data rights in the SIEPU Technical Data Package, it does not possess the requisite license rights in the Bell Process Specifications and Bell Standards necessary to compete the efforts anticipated. The estimated timeframe to qualify another source and develop the technical data for the requirements herein is eight (8) years based on historical UH-1Y/AH-1Z Upgrades data and, as such, an award to another source would result in an unacceptable delay in providing the supplies and services. Therefore, NAVAIR has determined Bell is the only responsible source capable of meeting the agency&rsquo;s requirements. This notice is for information purposes only.

To do so, provide answers to Capabilities and Business Information in accordance with Part II Communication, all shown below.
Program Description The F-15 Program Office anticipates awarding a new contract for upgrading existing F-15 Mode 4 APX-114 Interrogators and APX-119 Transponders.  The Mode 5 IFF upgrade will provide Mode 5 (Level 1) capability for the APX-114 and APX-119 on the F-15 models C/D/E via a hardware retrofit and software upgrade. Sources are sought to provide for the upgrade of Mode 4 capable APX-114 and APX-119 kits to Mode 5 capability, as well as an initial order of brand new APX-114 Mode 5 capable boxes to be utilized in a rotable pool. In particular, delivery of approximately 27 new Mode 5 capable APX-114 units will be required while approximately 450 APX-114 and APX-119 Mode 4 units will be supplied to the offeror for upgrade to Mode 5 capability. The period of performance will be 3 years from time of award, i.e., the USG desires to have the new Mode 5 units delivered and the Mode 4 to Mode 5 upgrades complete within three years from contract award. The offeror must be able to begin production and retrofit of the APX-114 and APX-119 boxes without any need for development, test, or configuration changes for an alternate solution.  The solution must conform to the current F-15 configuration and not require any changes.  Offeror must be able to provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS) repair, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) repair, Inventory Control Point (ICP), System Engineering and Program Management (SEPM), and training for maintenance of the Mode 5 boxes during the performance of a production contract.  The Offeror must demonstrate an ability to deliver all necessary data such as training materials, updated TCTO(s), updated TO(s), updated repair data, etc.  The Government currently owns 25 retrofit kits that would be utilized for the upgrade of Mode 4 capable boxes to Mode 5.  The Offeror must demonstrate an ability to utilize those kits in retrofitting Mode 4 capable boxes provided by the Government to the Mode 5 capability. The Government anticipates a rotable pool of approximately 52 APX-114 boxes and 52 APX-119 boxes.  The Offeror is requested to provide estimates of how fast (in months from inception to delivery) groups of interrogators and transponders could be factory retrofitted and must demonstrate an ability to manage both sets of rotable pools as Mode 4 boxes arrive for retrofit and upgraded boxes are sent out to the field.  It is anticipated that this is not a commercial item because this item is not used, sold, or made available to the commercial marketplace. 
Program Requirements The F-15 fleet has been fielded with the Mode 4 version of APX-114 and APX-119 since 2009. These units are Raytheon products and were originally procured and installed under the F-15 IFF Replacement Program. For the Mode 5 program, these units need to be upgraded with new software and new hardware.

The Offeror is requested to provide estimates of how fast (in months from inception to delivery) groups of interrogators and transponders could be factory retrofitted.d. In the event of an incoming Mode 4 unit failing acceptance testing, the offeror must be capable of repairing that unit.e. Major Risks: Identify any major performance, schedule or cost risks anticipated.
The contractor must be capable of providing brand new Mode 5 capable APX-114 interrogators. The contractor must also be capable of receiving Mode 4 APX-114 and APX-119 units and upgrading the software and hardware to Mode 5. In the event of an incoming Mode 4 unit failing acceptance testing, the offeror must be capable of repairing that unit. In accordance with AFFARS 5305.303 and AFI 16-201, foreign participation is excluded from participation. The contractor must also be able to provide ICS, GFE repair, ICP, SEPM, management of two rotable pools, and training during the performance of this production effort.  The Offeror must demonstrate an ability to perform all of these tasks without the need for development, test, or configuration changes.  A response offering other than the requirements in the above Program Description paragraph will be considered non-responsive.
