9c9f422e913d510982cb416d3a9ad5b2-re,RFQ1734140,"DHS CPB  Engineering, Technical and Logistical Support  Market Research","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through the General Services Administration (GSA), is seeking market research responses for a project aimed at enhancing the capabilities of Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO). Under the authority granted by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, DHS is tasked with preventing terrorist attacks, reducing vulnerabilities to terrorism, and minimizing damage from such events within the United States. The AMO division plays a critical role in this mission by leveraging air and marine resources to deter, interdict, and investigate acts of terrorism and smuggling across U.S. borders.

The focus of this solicitation is on providing comprehensive engineering, technical, and logistical support for CBP's fleet of aircraft, which includes P-3 Orion aircraft acquired from the U.S. Navy as well as Bombardier DHC-8 and King Air 350ER Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft. These aircraft are vital for conducting airborne law enforcement operations that include presidential protection, investigative assistance, airspace security operations at national venues, and interdiction missions targeting drugs and contraband entering the United States. The P-3s have been specifically modified into two configurations: Airborne Early Warning (AEW) variants for surveillance purposes and Long-Range Tracker (LRT) variants for interception missions.

The scope of work outlined in this solicitation encompasses a range of technical assistance services necessary to maintain optimal performance levels across CBP's aviation assets. This includes support for radar systems, optical equipment, communication systems, training on air vehicle operations and mission equipment usage, as well as repair services. Additionally, there is a need for modification services to keep these systems up-to-date with evolving threats. The project also involves maintaining ground station facilities that are crucial for avionics data development and providing depot-level technical support alongside thorough documentation services.

An essential component of this effort is ensuring robust satellite communications capabilities through PSC-SD tactical satellite radios to support AMO operations across various geographical locations including continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. This capability is crucial for effective coordination during missions aimed at safeguarding national security interests.",Federal Acquisition Service,2024-11-20 00:00:00+00:00,2024-11-20,2024-12-03 17:00:00+00:00,2024-12-03,,Sources Sought,,541330,Engineering Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEDERAL ACQUISITION SERVICE,,Boston,MA,02222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9c9f422e913d510982cb416d3a9ad5b2-re,,,,,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/r-RFQ1734140-re,https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/seller/prepare-quote/RFQ1734140?contractNumber=

1c3700a9bcda42d9bbef779f50679013,1305M224Q0265,Full P3 Equipment Overhaul and Repair Support Serv,"AOC requires a seven-year Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract designed to provide service, repair, and replacement of parts that are required to keep the aircraft in an airworthy condition to the maximum extent practical.The Lockheed Martin WP-3D Orion aircraft were originally manufactured in the mid-1970s. The airframe is no longer in production and the original primary user, the United States Navy, no longer maintains a large fleet of serviceable P-3s. The availability of serviceable parts and part suppliers is expected to decline over the remaining service life of  NOAA P-3s, estimated to end in 2031. For this reason, NOAA AOC requires support services that directly maintain the operation of several aircraft parts. Access to ready to place in service Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) will reduce aircraft down time and allow NOAA to continue to meet its mission requirements over the span of these contracts.As WP-3D operations are considered to be a year-round, 24-hour operation, an ideal contractor would be within a short driving distance from the AOC Lakeland facilities (100 miles or less) in order to ensure that parts requirements can be met at any time of day, any time of year. Consistent quality of work is essential for aircraft readiness.

The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 336413, Other Aircraft Part and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing7; the small business size standard is 1,250 Employees ^7.



This requisition is for the inspection and upgrade of three (3) Inflight Data Logger units.  These units are part of three ASW-60 Test Sets, PN:  89954ASSY115E3240G4.  The Data Logger units are a major part of these maintenance test sets and are used to perform airborne diagnostic checks of NOAA&rsquo;s WP-3D Orion aircraft ASW-60 digital autopilot system that is manufactured by BAE Systems Controls Inc.  Due to the obscurity of these units, the only qualified vendor for this work is the original equipment manufacturer which is BAE.  These are sealed units that will be serviced and maintained by BAE and when necessary, are updated by BAE with their proprietary software.  These units cannot be used on any other aircraft or any other system.  Currently, due to proprietary software obsolescence, all three units are incapable of troubleshooting the currently installed ASW-60 digital autopilot system while it is airborne.  These three units represent the only available spares for the P-3 fleet.  If these units fail, for whatever reason, they must be removed from service and returned to BAE for repair.  In the event these units are removed from service the aircraft would be grounded until necessary repairs could be made, resulting in a failure to meet AOC&rsquo;s primary mission of hurricane reconnaissance and research.

WP-3D Maintenance Support for NOAA AOC
DisclaimerThis announcement constitutes a Sources Sought only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), for the purpose of determining market capability of sources or obtaining information.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services discussed in this notice.  Any formal solicitation that may subsequently be issued will be announced separately through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).  Submission of a response to this Sources Sought is entirely voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this Sources Sought shall not obligate NOAA to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation at this time.  In order to protect the integrity of any future procurement, additional information will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made in reference to this Sources Sought.
All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Please do not submit any proprietary or classified information.
IntroductionThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA.  Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA's prioritized airborne requirements.
PurposeThe purpose of this Sources Sought is to obtain information about the capability and availability of industry to provide full service maintenance support for NOAA's two (2) WP-3D aircraft for a duration of 10-years.
BackgroundThe NOAA AOC operates and maintains two WP-3D Lockheed Orion aircraft, N42RF and N43RF. These aircraft are flown in support of NOAA scientists primarily for the purpose of severe weather research in environments such as hurricanes and mesoscale thunderstorms. Both WP-3D aircraft were acquired from Lockheed Burbank in 1975 (N42RF) and 1976 (N43RF). These aircraft have been maintained throughout their life cycle in accordance with the guidelines set forth in OPNAVINST 4790. Deviations from inspection criteria set forth in OPNAVINST 4790 have been made in order to satisfy NOAA mission and operating requirements. These deviations have been made in the time or calendar cycles only. The deviations have not precluded any of the maintenance or inspection criteria set forth in this instruction. The NOAA/AOC Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM) program is dynamic and changes to meet the mission demands and adapt to findings noted during routine inspections conducted between major scheduled maintenance. The NOAA/AOC currently follows a 72-month interval Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) program for the P-3 aircraft or a more comprehensive inspection if one exists with plans to move to an 84-month program.
ScopeThe contractor shall provide all necessary tools, special tools, labor, and parts (encompassing all tools, special tools, labor, and parts to accomplish work to include but not limited to a major wing, empennage, and/or fuselage structural component repair or replacement) to perform the following requested work:
&bull;	A full Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) inspection with 100% corrosion removal.
&bull;	Inspection shall include the SSI (Structurally Significant Inspection) Revision B inspection and structural repairs required by the SSI now in affect for the P-3 aircraft. 
&bull;	All discrepancies found during the SDLM inspection shall be corrected unless unforeseen events such as unavailability of parts, etc. prevent correction of the discrepancy. 
&bull;	All ""Safety of Flight"" discrepancies shall be corrected before the acceptance of the aircraft by NOAA/AOC.
&bull;	A limited list of any ""Noted but not Corrected"" (NBNC) discrepancies may be provided to NOAA/AOC for review prior to the acceptance of the aircraft. 
&bull;	Paint aircraft in accordance with the latest NOAA/AOC paint drawings, paint and NOAA logo stencil. Technical specifications and Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) can be found at www.ppgaerospace.com.
&bull;	Weigh aircraft in accordance with NAVAIR 01-75PAA-XX upon completion of paint. Provide to NOAA/AOC a properly documented Form B showing Basic Weight, Moment, Center of Gravity in Percent of Mean Aerodynamic Cord, Center of Gravity Arm in Inches, and Index.
&bull;	Structural Maintenance - Support for major structural repair requirements on WP-3D aircraft to include, but not limited to, corrosion inspections, repair and/or replacements of structural components (such as landing gear, wing flaps, flight controls, etc.), and sustainment of lower fuselage radome systems.
&bull;	Engineering Support - Including platform sustainment, Local Engineering Specifications (LES) and Requests for Engineering Information (REI) functions and technical assistance. 
&bull;	Supply - Support for components, accessories and kit procurement that may or may not be procurable/repairable through normal supply channels, but are available through CBP without placement of additional contract vehicles.
&bull;	Freight - reimbursement of freight shipment costs associated with above services.
&bull;	Regulatory, safety and other upgrades/support for repairs or installations of aircraft modifications needed to meet FAA or International Civil Aviation Organization requirements and other safety needs. To include but not limited to, engineering, design and installation of updated systems and the maintenance of the Inertial Navigation Units.
Quality assurance of all work tasks shall be certified as completed by the technician performing the task and verified using applicable selected contractor and OPNAV 4790.2H QA procedures. Certified technicians shall inspect and verify all completed work tasks have been accomplished using aviation industry acceptable methods, techniques and practices throughout the inspection and modification of the aircraft.
A NOAA/AOC maintenance check flight crew shall support all required functional check flights in accordance with NA01-75PAC-1F, OPNAVINST 4790.2H, OPNAVINST 3710.7S, and NA01-75PAC-1 following the completion of all tasks and prior to acceptance of the aircraft. If any discrepancies are noted or system(s) failure(s) occur during any flights prior to acceptance, NOAA/AOC and the selected contractor will review and discuss options for the resolution of the discrepancies.
Corrective actions, such as removal and replacement of parts, repair of parts, rigging; adjustments, etc. will be considered as an ""over-and-above"" expense. NA01-75PAC-1F shall be used to document the PMCF.  Results of post flight inspections and corrections shall be documented in accordance with applicable NOAA/AOC and selected contractor documentation procedures.
The Contractor will be responsible for all required documentation, to include but not limited to approval for return to service.
Insurance against Loss or Damage to Government Property The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain liability insurance of not less than $50,000,000.00 to cover the airframe on which the work will be performed.
Parts, Discounts, and Warranties The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous, at any time during the contract.  The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed on the aircraft.  Parts or components in an ""as removed"" condition will not be installed on the aircraft.  Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above.  Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet this criteria, maintenance contractors shall provide the labor rate they will charge the government, per hour for ""over and above"" discrepancies.
All aircraft, engine, propeller, accessory and component parts installed by the contractor shall have traceability to an approved part manufacturer. Contractor shall use FAA Advisory Circular 20-62D as a guideline to prevent the installation of unapproved parts. It is understood by the government that parts associated with the P-3 aircraft do not come with a FAA 8130-3 Airworthiness Approval Tag. However, an equivalent tag with the part number, serial number (if applicable), lot number (if applicable), date of manufacture, overhaul or repair, manufacturer, overhaul or repair facility name, and technician signature or stamp should be provided with the part. Any suspect part should be dealt with in accordance with the Advisory Circular and a new part obtained for installation on the aircraft.
Period of Performance Due to mission requirements and the operational schedule of the NOAA WP-3D fleet, the selected contractor will be asked for a turn-around time not to exceed 200 calendar days for the SDLM inspection and 30 calendar days for the individual phase inspections.  This period begins when the aircraft is delivered to the selected contractor's facility or designated FBO and ends when the aircraft is ready to be picked up at the contractor's facility or the selected paint shop after full repaint (for the SDLM inspection).  Other periods of performance will be negotiated and agreed upon by the contractor and NOAA prior to issuance of a task order.
Should abnormal requirements and/or circumstances occur which would require an extension of the agreed upon performance period, the selected contractor should immediately provide documentation to the CO (Contracting Officer) as to the reason and extent of the abnormal requirements and/or circumstances.  The selected contractor shall also provide the best estimate of the extension required in calendar days.
Certification Maintenance contractors must provide proof that the facility performing the service is a licensed Lockheed-Martin Orion Service Center and has performed this type of work within the last 90 days. Contractors will provide proof of FAA certificated Airframe and Powerplant (A&amp;P) maintenance technicians or Transport of Canada certificated Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AME) who are employed in positions which can certify work of non-certificated technicians or engineers.

These planes perform atmospheric research and hurricane research and reconnaissance missions. Both P3 aircraft are now equipped with the AN/ASW-60 Digital Autopilot System (DAS). Currently, Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) has only one test kit for the DAS, currently used for N42. It is a requirement to have a test kit for each aircraft as the aircraft will be at different locations at any given point in time.

It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made as multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with a minimum.   The period of performance is expected to be four years.   The RFP and resulting contract(s) will be for repairs of Department of Navy/US Government Lockheed P-3 Orion landing gear, both nose landing gear (NIIN 008671279) and main landing gear (NIIN 001796510).   The items are Critical Safety Items (CSI) and as such any interested company must become an approved source before award via submission of a Source Approval Request (SAR) to the cognizant engineering authority at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR); such submissions are to be furnished initially to NAVSUP WSS, which will forward the SAR to NAVAIR.
  Directions for preparing/submitting a SAR are set out below.

The P-3 Orion aircraft is in its sundown phase as its maritime patrol function is taken over by the Boeing P-8 Poseidon.   The total requirement across all four years is expected to be:

NIIN 008671279 (nose): 	29 repairs
NIIN 001796510 (main): 	64 repairs

These are expected to be the final requirements before the P-3 Orion is removed from service.  There are currently multiple approved sources for these repairs.   While NAVSUP WSS has repair technical data to supply to potential offerors for the preparation of SARs, and NAVSUP WSS always welcomes new sources, potential offerors should take note that because these items are designated CSI and for safety reasons SAR approval for such items can take 1 -2 years, any SAR submitted at this time would not be in time for this award.
   And while sundowning programs sometimes dont result in the full retirement of an aircraft type on schedule, i.e., there are sometime service life extensions, no projection of an extension is warranted here.

For guidance on submitting a SAR, see the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS source approval brochure which can be obtained online at:  https://www.navsup.navy.mil/public/navsup/wss/business_opps under commodities.

60ec963c929f9541d4f68ceb0b69326a,N00383-17-R-RFIP8,NAVSUP WSS Phila. P-8 Commercial Common Industry Day," 
IMPORTANT NOTICE:  THE FOLLOWING 3 PARAGRAPHS CHANGE THE ORIGINAL PROCESS FOR SIGN-UP FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES.
1.     NAVSUP WSS has received a series of email requests for time slots for follow-up individual meetings with Government representatives (45 minute closed meetings with such representatives) on Tuesday 13 June and Wednesday 14 June 2017.  The FedBizOps notice of the Monday 12 June 2017 Industry Day established that attendees would need to sign up for such follow-up meeting on-site at Industry Day at the close of that day. 
2.     In order to facilitate attendees making travel arrangements, NAVSUP WSS is changing the process for requesting a time slot.  Attendees who have registered or who are registering may now request a time slot for either Tuesday or Wednesday via email to the Contracting Officer Debra Zaslow at debra.zaslow@navy.mil.  Those attendees who have already registered and emailed a request for a time slot need not re-send such request. 
3.     No time slots have yet been allocated and this will be done by a random drawing on Wednesday 31 May 2017 at 15:00 EST.  NAVSUP will then communicate by return email that day before 16:30 EST from contracting officer Debra Zaslow the time slot each attendee seeking a follow-up meeting has been allocated.  While NAVSUP WSS recognizes that this allocation approach may mean travel plans will need to be made for two days versus one day or be made later than desire, it has been determined that this is the only way to treat all attendees fairly in the allocation of time slots.  NOTE: In the event that, after the random drawing, there are more attendees seeking follow-up meetings that there are available time slots on Tuesday 13 June and Wednesday 14 June, NAVSUP WSS will make arrangements for future video teleconferences for such follow-up meetings.
As a follow-up to the recent Government FedBizOps (FBO) announcement on 8 February 2017 addressing future innovative repair support for commercial common items for the P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft (""P-8 Commercial Common Readiness Solution""),  Naval Supply Systems Command, Weapons Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) will be hosting an Industry Day on 12 Jun 2017.  
 The purpose of the Industry Day will be to improve understanding of both Government requirements and industry capabilities/ideas for such innovative repair support.  The Industry Day will begin at 10:00 a.m. at NAVSUP WSS, 700 Robbins Ave., Building 1, Main Conference Room B, Floor 2 (across from Room 2400) Philadelphia, PA 19111 (see directions below).   Because of limited parking availability and the requirement to register at the NAVSUP Visitor Center, attendees are strongly encouraged to allow for adequate time prior to the start of the meeting.  
 Note that attendees at Industry Day will have the opportunity to sign up that day for a follow-up individual meeting with Government representatives (i.e., a closed meeting with such representatives)  at a point during the subsequent two days, i.e., during 13 and 14 June 2017.   See the additional discussion below as to such individual meetings.
  
BACKGROUND:
NAVSUP WSS is responsible for, among other things, procurement of supply support for Department of Navy aircraft, including procurement of repairs of repairable items.  
The P-8 Poseidon is an aircraft derived from the Boeing 737-800 commercial airliner.   Although the P-8 carries out a strictly military role for the U.S. Navy, some items on the aircraft are unmodified 737 items.   These are referred to as ""commercial common"" items; they are also sometimes referred to as COTS or ""commercial off the shelf.""  All items contemplated for repair will be unmodified COTS items.  It is expected that the number of distinct items covered by the contemplated contract would be upwards of 900.   (While some other P-8 commercial common items have been subject to modification from 737 configurations, such items will not be included in this contemplated contract.)     
 With the recent commencement and ongoing expansion of deployment of P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to replace Lockheed P-3 Orion propeller-driven aircraft, NAVSUP WSS currently has  sole source commercial common item repair contracts with Boeing, the P-8's Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and with other OEMs for their commercial common items used on the P-8.   These all require repair by Federal Aviation Regulation Part 145 repair stations, including, upon completion of a repair, issuance of an FAA Form 8130-3 Authorized Release Certificate/Airworthiness Approval Tag or Navy-approved equivalent.
The commercial repairable items that will be included in this proposed effort are listed in the Attachment.  
 NAVSUP WSS believes a single competitive, more efficient commercial common repair support solution--one contract covering repair of all the OEMs' commercial common items--may be possible in the future through more direct leveraging of 737 commercial repair expertise.  The P-8, however, as a commercial derivative aircraft, poses unique challenges.  
For example, a key challenge in the early deployment of the P-8 is commercial common item repair demand forecasting.   Only 61 of a projected 126 P-8s are operational to date.  Repair history is thus limited.  While having many commercial common parts, the P-8 flies a military flight envelope unlike the envelope of any 737.  In addition, the P-8 does not have an FAA Type Certificate; the Navy engineering community retains engineering cognizance.  In addition, P-8 commercial common items undergoing repair at Part 145 repair stations may not be co-mingled with 737 commercial common items, i.e., per FAA mandate P-8 items stay in a ""closed loop"" with no repaired P-8 commercial common item placed on any commercial 737 airliner.  (A repaired item from a commercial 737 could in theory be furnished for the P-8 under the contemplated contract--however, such item would then be added to the closed loop and not be returnable to any commercial 737.   This is not optimal, however, because it would increase the size and cost of the closed loop pool of Navy-owned assets.)
 In light of factors such as those above, what is notionally contemplated for the future is competitive award of a repair support contract to a contractor familiar with 737 commercial repairs.
 STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:
 NAVSUP WSS currently contemplates its objectives for the P-8 Commercial Common Readiness Solution contract as follows.
 Objective 1--  
Contractor will:
           -FORECAST commercial common item repair demand, using a                    combination of:
 
(i)            737 repair demand data obtained/maintained by the contractor 
(ii)           P-8A commercial common item repair demand history data provided by the Navy (""this is what the P-8 has experienced prior to contract award"") 
(iii)           P-8A general, non-sensitive, flight envelope data (""this is how the P-8 flies differently from the 737"")
(iv)          Yearly flight hour projections provided by the Navy.
 Objective 2--  
Contractor will:
 
-PROVIDE, using such contractor forecasting, commercial common item repair support characterized by:       
 
(a)    A parts universe comprising COTS repairable items (aircraft and possibly engine) in support of U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and possibly other U.S. allied armed forces 
(b)   Repairs exclusively performed by FAR Part 145 repair stations, including furnishing of FAA 8130-3 tag or Navy-approved equivalent as acceptance documentation
(c)    Order fulfillment metrics TBD, including as short as 2 days for CONUS Issue Priority Group 1 (IPG1) requisitions (e.g., aircraft on ground situations)
(d)   Wholesale inventory management to include warehousing &amp; shipping (to CONUS &amp; OCONUS locations, including to Australian DoD or other U.S. allied armed forces)
(e)   Other supply support including, but not limited to, providing notification to NAVSUP WSS of any/all commercial 737 COTS item configuration changes and notification to NAVSUP WSS of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources &amp; Material Shortages (DMSMS) problems/issues.
(f)   Ability to fill requirements previously unidentified to the U.S. Navy supply system (""part number"" requisitions)
(g)   Flexibility to accept addition to contract of new items/new configurations of items 
(h)  Ability to accept &amp; operate using U.S. Navy Commercial Asset Visibility (CAV) system - NAVSUP WSS will provide training if necessary
(i)    Contract length TBD; likely 2-5 years (including base period and options)
 
Objective 3--  
Contractor will:
 -COMPLY WITH Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)/Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) requirements, specifically those of FAR Part 12 ""Acquisition of Commercial Items"" and DFARS Part 212 ""Acquisition of Commercial Items.""   These may include, but not be limited to, such provisions as:
&bull;   252.246-7007 Counterfeit Electronic Part Detection and Avoidance System 
&bull;   252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation (IUID)*
&bull;   252.204-7008 Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls
&bull;   252.204-7009 Limitations on the Use or Disclosure if Third Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information
&bull;   252.204-7012 Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident reporting
[*It should be noted that as to Item Unique Identification (IUID) requirements, in P-8 repair contracts NAVSUP WSS' practice has been for the contracting parties to agree that IUID requirements are implemented in accordance with the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) P-8 IUID Implementation Plan, Rev H. All attendees are asked to prepare to discuss the objectives outlined above and provide thoughts/ideas on how the Government can accomplish the objectives.  
It should be noted that Industry Day on 12 June 2017 will be an open forum with all attendees and Government representatives participating in a joint session.  It is anticipated that in that open forum the Government representatives will further discuss the objectives above and take questions on such objectives.  A period for open forum feedback by attendees will follow.  
The individual company meetings available for 13 and 14 June 2017 are expected to be structured as follows.   All attendees will be given, upon signing up for an individual meeting, a set of initial Government questions (the same set will be given to all attendees) regarding company capabilities/views.   Attendees will address those in the individual meetings; follow-up company-specific questions and answers may thereafter be entertained during such individual meetings.   It is expected that each such individual company meeting will last 45 minutes to an hour.
Any information or ideas shared during Industry Day or any individual meeting may be used to develop NAVSUP WSS P-8 Commercial Common Readiness Solution acquisition documents.  Note, the Government will NOT assume any liability for any contractor expenses for responding to this notice or for expenses for attending the Industry Day.
