Definitions:

TSATC - Transportation Security Administration Training Center located on the Federal Aviation Administration&rsquo;s William J. Hughes Technical Center in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. The TSATC is comprised of 13 buildings, however only the Multipurpose Training Building, commonly known as Building 360, has Aircraft Cabin Training Simulators (ACTS) in it.

Building 360 &ndash; this is the Building number assigned by the FAA to the Transportation Security Administration Training Center (TSATC) Multipurpose Training Building, which houses all of the aircraft simulators. This is also the common name of the building amongst staff and Contractors. The building is a clear-span-purlin-type pre-engineered 30,000sqft building, approximately half of which is completely open. This open area referred is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;High Bay Area&rdquo; which houses all of the Aircraft Cabin Training simulators.

High Bay Area &ndash; Common name for a 15,000sqft room within Building 360 which houses all of the Aircraft Cabin Training Simulators (ACTS).

ACTS &ndash; Aircraft Cabin Training Simulator, general term for aircraft simulator

Platform I &ndash; an ACTS that simulates a 767 aircraft with the addition of a staircase mid-ship that leads to an upper deck. Although the staircase and upper deck was not typical on real 767 aircraft, this ACTS design allowed TSA to simulate both 767 and 747 configurations within the same footprint. The design of Platform I used substantial structure steel members to support the Platform II ACTS above it. This ACTS is approximately 99ft in length.

Platform II &ndash; an ACTS that simulates a 747 upper deck. The Platform II was originally installed on top of the Platform I to form a single ACTS that could be used as a 747 trainer, a 767 trainer, or both simultaneously. This ACTS is approximately 70ft in length.

Platform V - an ACTS that simulates a 767 aircraft cabin only. There is no flight deck in this simulator. This ACTS did not have the robust features that other ACTS at the TSATC have and was designed and constructed for field use throughout the country. There are roughly 14 Platform V ACTS in use throughout the country and all were designed and built similarly. This ACTS is approximately 51ft in length.

ACY &ndash; is the airport identifier for the Atlantic City International Airport. The TSATC is located adjacent to the Atlantic City International Airport and therefor the term ACY is sometimes used to describe the TSATC as other TSA locations are often described by the airport identifier they are located closest to.

Instructor Operating Station (IOS) &ndash; This is the console where the simulators are controlled from. Each IOS contains a touchscreen device where the functions of the simulator can be operated, as well as control buttons, a master key-switch and a DVR.

DVR &ndash; Digital Video Recorder, a device that records video from camera inputs and saves the video to a hard drive in a format that can be searched by time, date, or motion and exported in standardized video formats if necessary.

CO- Contracting Officer. An individual warranted and authorized by the head of a Federal agency to enter into a contract with an entity.

COR - Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative. Ensure that Contractors meet the commitment of their contracts. They ensure proper development of requirements and assist Contracting Officers in managing their contracts

Definitions: TSATC - Transportation Security Administration Training Center located on the Federal Aviation Administration&rsquo;s William J. Hughes Technical Center in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. The TSATC is comprised of 13 buildings, however only the Multipurpose Training Building, commonly known as Building 360, has Aircraft Cabin Training Simulators (ACTS) in it.

Building 360 &ndash; this is the Building number assigned by the FAA to the Transportation Security Administration Training Center (TSATC) Multipurpose Training Building, which houses all of the aircraft simulators. This is also the common name of the building amongst staff and Contractors. The building is a clear-span-purlin-type pre-engineered 30,000sqft building, approximately half of which is completely open. This open area referred is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;High Bay Area&rdquo; which houses all of the Aircraft Cabin Training simulators.

High Bay Area &ndash; Common name for a 15,000sqft room within Building 360 which houses all of the Aircraft Cabin Training Simulators (ACTS).

ACTS &ndash; Aircraft Cabin Training Simulator, general term for aircraft simulator

Platform I &ndash; an ACTS that simulates a 767 aircraft with the addition of a staircase mid-ship that leads to an upper deck. Although the staircase and upper deck was not typical on real 767 aircraft, this ACTS design allowed TSA to simulate both 767 and 747 configurations within the same footprint. The design of Platform I used substantial structure steel members to support the Platform II ACTS above it. This ACTS is approximately 99ft in length.

Platform II &ndash; an ACTS that simulates a 747 upper deck. The Platform II was originally installed on top of the Platform I to form a single ACTS that could be used as a 747 trainer, a 767 trainer, or both simultaneously. This ACTS is approximately 70ft in length.

Platform V - an ACTS that simulates a 767 aircraft cabin only. There is no flight deck in this simulator. This ACTS did not have the robust features that other ACTS at the TSATC have and was designed and constructed for field use throughout the country. There are roughly 14 Platform V ACTS in use throughout the country and all were designed and built similarly. This ACTS is approximately 51ft in length.

ACY &ndash; is the airport identifier for the Atlantic City International Airport. The TSATC is located adjacent to the Atlantic City International Airport and therefor the term ACY is sometimes used to describe the TSATC as other TSA locations are often described by the airport identifier they are located closest to.

Instructor Operating Station (IOS) &ndash; This is the console where the simulators are controlled from. Each IOS contains a touchscreen device where the functions of the simulator can be operated, as well as control buttons, a master key-switch and a DVR.

DVR &ndash; Digital Video Recorder, a device that records video from camera inputs and saves the video to a hard drive in a format that can be searched by time, date, or motion and exported in standardized video formats if necessary.

CO- Contracting Officer. An individual warranted and authorized by the head of a Federal agency to enter into a contract with an entity.

COR - Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative. Ensure that Contractors meet the commitment of their contracts. They ensure proper development of requirements and assist Contracting Officers in managing their contracts
