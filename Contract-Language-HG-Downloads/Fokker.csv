This is not a request for quotes, request for proposal, or a solicitation of any kind, and does not constitute a commitment by the U.S. Government. Responses, in any form, are not and will not be considered offers. The U.S. Government is under no obligation to award any contracts following this RFI. Responses are strictly voluntary, and funds expended in preparing them will not be reimbursed.

Introduction

The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), Arlington, VA, is conducting market research for a contemplated component repair contract for F-35 aircraft Wheel &amp; Brake components and assemblies. The work is currently being performed through the F-35 Air System Support Integrator, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, Fort Worth, TX.

Overview:

The proposed contract will require F-35 supply chain management and repair for all wheel &amp; brake assembly components.  Logistics functions will include, but are not limited to: repair, replenishment, overhaul, engineering support, packaging, storage, transportation, and inventory management.  The Contractor will be required to perform all these functions for depot-level repairables. The Contractor will be required to partner with U.S. Government entities inside the continental United States (CONUS), such as Organic Depots (currently, Ogden Air Logistics Complex [OO-ALC], Hill Air Force Base, Utah), and subcontract with commercial repair sources outside the continental United States (OCONUS) (currently, Fokker Technologies in the Netherlands, and Rosebank Engineering in Australia). Provisioning and cataloguing data will be required deliverables under this contract to support future induction of the components into the Department of Defense Working Capital Fund.  

Supply Chain Management:

For the anticipated requirement, the incumbent contractor will retain responsibility of the Global Spares Pool (GSP) and the associated inventory management for F-35 Wheels and Brakes components. Under the proposed acquisition, repairable assets will be sent to the awarded contractor, and the contractor will be responsible for managing repair of the assets through the existing repair facilities at CONUS and OCONUS repair facilities. Once repairs are complete and A-condition assets are accepted, the contractor will be responsible for packaging the assets and shipping them to the appropriate F-35 location. As such, the selected contractor will be responsible for inventory management during repair and through the delivery, back to the GSP.  Procurement of replenishment consumable parts required for repair will also be the responsibility of the contractor. 

Provisioning and Cataloging Data:

Any potential contractor will be responsible for delivering cataloging and provisioning data to the U.S. Government. The applicable data will be delivered pursuant to contract data requirements lists (CDRLs). Delivery will be monthly and continue throughout the duration of the contract until all data requirements specified in Table A for all F-35 Wheels and Brakes has been received and validated. 

Data Transactions:

The contractor will be responsible for completing and maintaining the Electronic Equipment Logbooks (EELs) associated with the Wheels and Brakes workload. This will require an interface with multiple systems which are owned by the F-35 Air System Support Integrator. The U.S. Government will ensure that all interfaces continue to be supported.

The period of performance for this effort will be for a one-year base, with the potential for up to four additional one-year options, with an expected award between FY24 and FY25.
