All design deliverables, including drawings, will be completed using AutoCAD 2024 or newer versions and provided in both AutoCAD and PDF formats, adhering to standard VA formats and guidelines. The project design will align with the appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) standards, specifications, and Boise VAMC-specific requirements, using pertinent references available online. The estimated construction budget for this project is approximately $800,000, aiming to transform the existing infrastructure into a fully functional, paved area compliant with VA standards and ensuring sustainability and quality. 
Information Sought
The Government requests a letter of interest (or similar document) with responses to the following:
1. State your business name (as it appears in SAM.gov ), office location where these services will be performed from, SAM UEI number, and socio-economic status of the firm (i.e. verified SDVOSB, WOSB, SB, large business). 
2. Provide a brief narrative on your company s experience providing services similar to those described in the attached statement of work.
3. What would be the expected make-up of the company s team in terms of socio-economic categories and estimated percentage of work to be completed by your company and each subcontractor? 
If the procurement is set-aside for any category of small business, generally fifty percent of more of the work would need to be performed by the contractor or a similarly situated subcontractor in terms of percentage of cost. For instance, if set-aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), 50% or more of the contract would need to be performed by verified SDVOSBs no other small business categories would count towards the percentage. If set-aside for small business, 50% of the contract would be required to be performed by small businesses which would include performance by a verified SDVOSB because they are also a small business. If the procurement is not set-aside and reaches certain dollar thresholds, the Government would negotiate an acceptable subcontracting plan to utilize small business concerns.
4. A brief statement of overall interest in the project and capability of performing the work in conjunction with ongoing projects.
5. Any additional capabilities statements or other documentation that you feel will assist the Government in performing market research and determining the appropriate set-aside.

3feed9f14d404580b4f5ce0a502a97a7,AMDTCNOI2502035,Ouster OS2-128 Channel LiDAR,"Introduction
This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation.  A solicitation document will not be issued, and quotations will not be requested.  

Purpose
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed priced purchase order on a brand name only basis with authorized resellers of Ouster, Inc. The purchase order will specifically procure an Ouster OS2-128 Channel LiDAR. Delivery is required within 5 weeks after contractor receipt of order.



Authority
This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of FAR Subpart 11.105 allowing the Contracting Officer (CO) to solicit items peculiar to one manufacturer. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with the small business size standard of 1,350 Employees. 


Description
The NIST Intelligent Systems Division&#39;s (ISD) mission is to advance measurement science for sensing and perception systems, particularly for Automated Vehicle (AV) safety and performance. ISD uses LiDAR for precise object detection and distance measurement for sensor fusion tasks which is crucial for improving AV perception performance. Existing LiDAR resources are insufficient for current ISD research needs resulting in a requirement a new LiDAR resource.



Sole Source Determination
The sole source determination is based on the following:



NIST currently owns and operates an Ouster OS1-32 LiDAR for research purposes. A 128-channel LiDAR is now required for NIST efforts and the new system must interoperate with the existing Ouster system. NIST&rsquo;s research projects which will use the new system were design around the Ouster ROS framework, driver package, and Autoware stack. Other brands of LiDAR will not work with the existing setup which includes a custom rack design around use of Ouster LiDAR technology. Only the Ouster OS2-128 LiDAR is capable of meeting NIST needs. Ouster authorizers resellers; however none of the resellers are small businesses. Therefore, to ensure compatibility with existing research apparatuses, a brand name only competition amongst Ouster authorized resellers is the only appropriate acquisition strategy.



Information for Interested Parties
Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing by or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation.

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Collin Randall, Contract Specialist, at Collin.Randall@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted via email to Collin.Randall@nist.gov so that they are received no later than August 13, 2025, at 10:00 AM, Eastern Time.


Each response should include the following Business Information:




	Contractor Name, Address,
	Point of Contact Name, Phone Number, and Email address
	Contractor SAM Universal Entity Identifier (UEI)
	Contractor Business Classification (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, hubZone, veteran owned, etc.) as validated in System for Award Management (SAM). All offerors must have an active registration in www.SAM.gov.

The 8011M Edge Tech Acoustic Command/Ranging Deck Unit properties and engineering design specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by another manufacturer. EDGEONE LLC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the equipment. Therefore, the government intends to negotiate directly with EDGEONE LLC avoiding unnecessary mark ups, delay, warranty, and delivery issues.

The Government intends to acquire this part under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with EDGEONE LLC. under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with a business size standard of 1350 employees. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any interested party that is an authorized distributor, re-seller, dealer from EDGEONE LLC. and can provide the above requirement, at no additional mark ups, without compromising manufacturing, delivery and warranty may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by August 11, 2025 at 5:00 PM EST. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

97ac8176f8ee4b20880743d4314b9d46,S-133647,TECHNOLOGY LICENSING OPPORTUNITY: Extremely Low Resource Optical Identifier (ELROI),"Engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed a &ldquo;license plate&rdquo; for satellites to help solve the growing problem of space traffic management. The Extremely Low-Resource Optical Identifier (ELROI) is a simple, easy-to-fly, solar-powered beacon that can be attached to a satellite for tracking. Each ELROI unit transmits a custom identification number that can be read from the ground using signal processing techniques also developed at Los Alamos.

The Challenge:

Identifying space objects after launch remains a persistent challenge. When dozens of satellites are deployed simultaneously, determining which object is which using traditional radar or optical tracking methods is slow, error-prone, or sometimes impossible. This lack of real-time, reliable identification hinders satellite commissioning, increases operational risk, and undermines space traffic management efforts.

Unidentified satellites are particularly problematic after their radio systems are disabled or fail. Without continuous, verifiable identification, defunct satellites add uncertainty to orbital catalogs and increase the risk of collision.

Problems Solved:

ELROI solves the space object identification problem by providing an autonomous, low-cost, optical beacon that broadcasts a unique ID from orbit. ELROI:


	enables definitive post-launch identification of satellites faster than conventional means;
	operates without RF emissions, making it ideal for use even after satellite deactivation;
	functions autonomously, activating and broadcasting without requiring power or communication from the host spacecraft; and
	continues operation even after satellite passivation, offering a persistent identity signal over the object&rsquo;s orbital lifetime.


In 2024&ndash;25, ELROI was demonstrated successfully on LaCE-1 and R5-S4 satellites, providing the first definitive identification for each satellite in orbit ahead of operator or catalog resolution.

Key Advantages


	Ultra-Low SWaP-C (Size, Weight, Power, and Cost): Final designs aim for just a few grams and a few cubic centimeters, requiring minimal power.
	No RF Interference: Uses optical rather than radio frequency, sidestepping spectrum crowding and regulatory issues.
	Autonomous and Passive: No spacecraft support required; beacon runs independently, even on dead satellites.
	Fast and Robust Identification: High-confidence decoding of unique identifiers using ground-based photon counting techniques, even with low signal strength.
	Scalable and Flexible: Can be added to any space object, including CubeSats and deployable debris, without complex integration.
	Resilient Design: Uses robust encoding schemes (e.g., BCH error-correcting codes) to ensure ID recovery under high noise and low signal conditions.


Next Steps

For ELROI to become a standard part of space operations, three parallel tracks must advance:


	Beacon Manufacturing: Move from prototypes to production-scale manufacturing of standardized, miniaturized ELROI units.
	Ground Network Expansion: Establish a distributed network of ground stations using cost-effective photon-counting or hybrid imaging systems.
	Operator Adoption: Encourage satellite operators to integrate ELROI through demonstrated benefits, policy incentives, and regulatory encouragement.


Widespread use will grow as ELROI proves its value, stays low-cost, and gains support for improving space safety.

Market Applications: 


	Space Traffic Management: A standard beacon on all space objects reduces uncertainty, supports catalog maintenance, and improves deconfliction.
	Regulatory Compliance: Enables better enforcement of norms and international transparency for satellite tracking and ownership.
	Mission Assurance: Helps satellite operators confirm identity quickly after deployment, expediting commissioning and reducing risk.
	End-of-Life Management: Provides lasting identity for passivated or tumbling satellites, supporting sustainable space practices.
	Commercial Launch Services: Can be included as standard hardware on launch platforms to simplify post-launch operations for clients.

The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:



Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter&#39;s best terms from a technical, all submission requirements and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is



later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary or in the government&#39;s best interests. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:




	
	
		Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:
	
	


&bull;Quotes that are not received timely


	
	
		
		
			Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1
			Quotes that fail to submit ALL required documentation/provisions
			Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation
		
		
	
	





	
	
		Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.
	
	





	
	
		The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness (Factor 3) and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.
	
	




If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue in order by price until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.




	
	
		USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.

	The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision.





	The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation.




The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:



Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter&#39;s best terms from a technical, all submission requirements and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary or in the government&#39;s best interests. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:




	Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:


&bull;Quotes that are not received timely


	
	
		
		
			Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1
			Quotes that fail to submit ALL required documentation/provisions
			Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation
		
		
	
	





	
	
		Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.
	
	





	
	
		The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness (Factor 3) and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.
	
	




If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue in order by price until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.




	
	
		USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.
	
	




(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:



Factor 1. Technical Acceptability

Technical Acceptability will be rated on an &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;unacceptable&quot; basis as follows: Acceptable - Quoter completes the Attachment (1) Technical Compliance Table indicating the item meets the salient characteristics specified and all SOW 2.2 requirements and provides sufficient supporting documentation to show acceptability to the salient characteristics; and submits a completed Attachment (2) Reps and Certs document or indicates compliance with the Reps and Certs statement provided in the table of Attachment (1).

****THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS***

Requisition No: OS2025S3K0051

Intended Source: MITRE Corporation

Period of performance: 2-years

NAICS Codes:

&bull; 541330: Engineering Services  

Please note: This Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source contract was originally posted on SAM.GOV on or about March 20, 2025, as a 5-year effort.  The Notice of Intent was narrowed down to a 2-year effort instead.

Description of Requirement:

The Department of Transportation, Office of the Secretary intends to award a sole-source Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract award, solicit, and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1).

The intended CPFF contract will be a follow-on for 2-years and is for Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support services operated by The MITRE Corporation (MITRE). This is a new contract based on the current contract, which has a period of performance of August 1, 2025, to July 31, 2027.  The contract is between MITRE and the Department of Transportation, Office of Aviation Analysis (OAA). 

In 1990, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identified and formalized a need for a long-term relationship with an independent research and development entity that would provide essential research and engineering capabilities to support the FAA&#39;s mission. Based on this need, the FAA established an FFRDC. In partnership with the FFRDC, the FAA seeks to provide a safe, secure, and efficient global aviation system that contributes to the national economy, productivity, security, and the promotion of United States aviation interests. The FAA selected MITRE to operate the FFRDC designated as the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD).

In accordance with the definition of a FFRDC described in Part 35.017 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, an FFRDC is uniquely positioned to be able to provide support and guidance in an environment aligned with the needs of the OAA organization and free of competitive pressures because an FFRDC neither competes with private industry nor manufactures hardware products or software. The goal of this contract structure is to provide a contract vehicle that permits objective and independent support, eliminates the administrative costs of annual negotiations, and fosters the required program continuity.

Description of Supplies/Services: In the course of MITRE&rsquo;s long-term relationship with the FAA, MITRE has developed expertise in areas corresponding to the needs of OAA. The FAA Sponsoring Agreement for the operation of CAASD states that CAASD&rsquo;s role includes performance analysis and assessment of national airspace operations and conducting economic, environmental, and policy analysis of impacts on the national airspace system, operators, users, other stakeholders, and the Nation.

Through the proposed contract, the Government will obtain access to CAASD capabilities of specific interest to OAA, including analysis of: (1) Domestic and international aviation industry/markets; (2) Air carrier performance and practices; (3) Regulatory analysis; (4) Cost-benefit analysis; (5) Aviation policy analysis; (6) International trade; (7) Development and application of economic models; (8) Advanced econometrics and discrete choice modeling; (9) Consumer impacts; (10) Computable general equilibrium modeling; (11) Statistical analysis; and (12) Aviation forecasting.

Authority Cited: This action is authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) as implemented by FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), which states that &ldquo;full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award a contract to a particular source in order to&hellip;.establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other non-profit institution or a federally funded research and development center.&rdquo;

Demonstration that the Contractor&rsquo;s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the use of the Authority Cited Above (Applicability of Authority): An FFRDC executes activities that are sponsored under a broad charter by a Government agency for the purpose of performing, analyzing, integrating, supporting, and/or managing basic or applied research and/or development. This contract will be issued pursuant to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Sponsoring Agreement for the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), the FAA&rsquo;s FFRDC.

The role and use of FFRDCs are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (48 CFR 35.017). Specifically, the regulations state that FFRDCs:

&bull;           Exist to meet some special long-term research or development need which cannot be met as effectively by existing in-house or contractor resources.

&bull;           Enable agencies to use private sector resources to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of the sponsoring agency.

&bull;           Have access, beyond that common to normal contractors, to Government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, employees, equipment, and facilities.

&bull;           Must conduct their business in a manner befitting their special relationship with the Government, to operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts, and to have full disclosure of their affairs to the sponsoring agency.

&bull;           Are not intended to use their privileged information or access to compete with the private sector.

Furthermore, an FFRDC is uniquely enabled by the Government to perform work &ldquo;closely associated with inherently governmental functions&rdquo; as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Letter 11-01, Performance of Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions (76 Fed Reg 56227).

In addition, while no requirement exists to obtain competition for the reasons cited in paragraph 4, FAR 35.017-4(a) provides that in reviewing FFRDCs &ldquo;the sponsor, prior to extending the contract or agreement with an FFRDC, shall conduct a Comprehensive Review of the use and need for the FFRDC.&rdquo; The FAA, the sponsoring agent for the CAASD FFRDC, conducted a comprehensive review in FY2020. This review determined that there remains a requirement for an FFRDC and included consideration of alternative sources to meet the sponsor&rsquo;s needs. No additional review is required by the Department of Transportation at this time; the FAA Comprehensive Review has already satisfied this FAR requirement.  Awarding to a company other than MITRE who has already established relationship and proprietary information will cause a delay in services.

DOT will solicit and continue to negotiate directly with MITRE Corporation and no solicitation will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. Offerors must have an active registration in SAM.GOV (SAM) www.sam.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties must express their interest and must be submitted in writing via email to Melinda Riddick at Melinda.Riddick@dot.gov by 12:00 PM, Friday, August 1, 2025 and cc Robin Golden at Robin.Golden@dot.gov. No faxed documents will be accepted. If no responsive statements are received by the due date, an award will be made to The MITRE Corporation.

Performance Work Statement (PWS)
SPILL PREVENTION, CONTROL AND COUNTERMEASURE
PLAN 
VA Central California Health Care System


BACKGROUND:  The VA Central California Healthcare System (VA CCHCS) Medical Center requires contracted services to prepare a Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan for the Fresno VA Medical Center. The contractor shall provide all resources and expertise necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in this Performance Work Statement. 

In 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a rule amending the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation promulgated under the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act). The goal of the oil pollution prevention regulation in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 112, (40 CFR 112) is to prevent oil discharges from reaching navigable water of the United States or adjoining shorelines. Subparts A through C of the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation are often referred to as the ""SPCC rule"" because they describe the requirements to prepare, amend and implement SPCC Plans. The final rule to 40 CFR 112 took place on November 5, 2009. It eliminates the threshold single container capacity of 660 gallons, eliminates completely buried storage tanks, from 40 CFR 280 or 281, added an exclusion from SPCC for tanks smaller than 55 gallons, eliminated tanks used for wastewater treatment from SPCC requirements, and now requires visual and non-destructive testing.

SCOPE OF WORK:  The work will be divided into the following primary tasks:

TASK 1 - Review of existing documents (2013 SPCC Plan and Tanks Inventory) 
TASK 2A   Meet and interview facility Staff
TASK 2B   Inspect the facility
TASK 3   Prepare SPCC Plan Update
TASK 4   Train Staff on SPCC Plan Implementation

Contractor will review all buildings and details such as an elevator with a hydraulic oil reservoir, storm drain location(s), and existence of oil filled transformers for accuracy and legitimacy for inclusion in the SPCC and required updates. The contractor will review documentation of training conducted, with respect to regular inspections for oil leakage and emergency response actions that are required subsequent to the last SPCC Update. Contractor will review tank, pumping, piping, valving, and instrumentation documentation submitted to by the VACCHCS. Contractor will review operating and emergency procedures for tanks and ancillary equipment containing oil as defined by 40 CFR 112.

Task 2A Meet with the facility staff
Contractor will conduct a meeting at the facility with the facility staff. Contractor will review SPCC documentation with the VA staff and their status (current, out of date, adequate, needs more documentation) will be discussed. Contractor will review with VA staff the EPA definition of  oil  based on 40 CFR 112, to ensure that staff recognize materials meeting the definition of oil and discuss if all applicable items have been included in the inventory provided. 

Task 2B Inspect the facility 
Immediately following the meeting noted in Task 2A, the site visit would be conducted to examine the condition of tanks holding oil as defined by 40 CFR 112, their secondary containments, pumps, transfer facilities secondary containment structures, and instrumentation. During the walk VACCHCS Fresno maintenance manager/technician knowledgeable on the tanks, pumping, piping, secondary containment, instrumentation, storm and sanitary sewer drains, and electrical transformers will escort the contractor engineer around the facility. VACCHCS Fresno maintenance manager/technician will provide access to diesel storage tank enclosure, diesel day tanks, any elevator equipment room where the hydraulic oil reservoir, and storage locker for portable containers of paint and petroleum products. Contractor will be allowed to take photographs of pertinent features. Seven new buildings have been constructed since the 2013 SPCC: Building 19 (Switchgear), Building 19A (Generator Switchgear), Building 22A (Chiller Building), Building 25 (Freedom Building), Building 27 (Independence Building), Building 28 (Community Living Center Building), and Building LC-2 (Modular Trailers). All buildings (new and old) shall be included in the facility inspection. Several buildings and features have also been removed or demolished since the 2013 SPCC (Buildings 10, 12, 13, 14, 15). 

Task 3 Prepare SPCC Plan Update.
Contractor will prepare the new SPCC documents. Based on EPA requirements, each tank needs to be indicated on a Facility drawing. Contractor will annotate a VACCHCS provided current Facility Drawing which indicates the location of all existing buildings. Contractor will provide draft SPCC Plan in Microsoft Word format, to the person designated by the VACCHCS. That person will collect all comments from VACCHCS staff on one copy of the draft SPCC Plan. Contractor will receive this one version with all comments within 60 calendar days. Within 20-days after receiving comments from the VACCHCS, contractor will implement changes, if necessary, and issue the final version of the SPCC Plan, electronically, in MS Word and Portable Document Format (PDF) to the VA s COTR. Four hardcopies will then be mailed to the designated person at the VACCHCS, for their internal distribution.

a4f6d4aaefb3498399088088c0738d81,693JJ625R000002,Request for Information (RFI)/Industry Feedback on Draft Performance Work Statement for Parametric Railway Line Capacity Model,"Purpose:

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is seeking industry review and comment on a draft Parametric Railway Line Capacity Model (PRLC) Performance Work Statement (PWS) prior to the issuance of any formal solicitation.  The government may incorporate into the final version of the PWS any information or comments resulting from this request that is determined to be useful.

Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Industry is requested to review the attached Draft PWS and provide comments/feedback that will assist the FRA in refining its requirement. Respondents should not submit any proprietary information when responding to this RFI. Respondents are encouraged to review the draft PWS, and submit any comments or questions that may be useful for this requirement. All comments/questions will be evaluated and the draft PWS will be amended accordingly to reflect any changes FRA deems necessary to make.

Background: Since the 1975 publication of Federal Rail Administration&rsquo;s (FRA) Parametric Analysis of Railway Line Capacity Final Report , parametric railroad capacity models have seen sporadic use throughout the North American railroad industry as a tool to support both short-term and long-term network, traffic, and capital planning. While some individual railroads have developed and maintained propriety parametric models for their own internal use, the publicly available 1975 FRA model, which provided the initial conceptual framework for this approach to capacity analysis, has become largely obsolete due to major changes that have occurred over the past 50 years including railroad operating practices, traffic types, physical plant characteristics, and capacity utilization. 

During that same period, detailed railroad operations simulation emerged as the dominant tool for railroad capacity analysis. FRA has been a major proponent for the use of operations simulation an essential means of assessing the efficacy of proposed changes to railroad operations and infrastructure. Since most railway improvements require careful consideration of railway line capacity and operating performance, the need for an expanded set of tools for railroad capacity analysis has grown more important.

Objectives:

The U.S. Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) RRD-22 seeks to develop a new Parametric Railway Line Capacity Model (PRLCM) which, like the 1975 model, would be made publicly available for use by both the railroad industry and by others with an interest in railroad capacity analysis (such as sponsors of potential railroad improvement projects). The first step towards this objective is to develop the parametric railway line capacity model and test it prior to undertaking the project to publicly launch the tool. FRA believes that a new parametric capacity model would have the potential to serve as an important adjunct to existing railroad operations simulation tools and could find application in: high-level operations analysis that is performed as part of early project feasibility studies, regional intercity passenger rail planning, and as an aid in developing hypotheses for operating and infrastructure changes for subsequent evaluation using operations simulation. 

 Like the 1975 model, development of a new parametric capacity model would focus on an analytical examination of key factors affecting railway line capacity to:


	Determine the relative magnitude of the impact of varying key parameters such as track and signal system configuration and train operating policy in terms of their effect on capacity; and
	Develop a parametric model for general application to railroad capacity analysis.


 As was the case in the development of the 1975 model, a key element of a new parametric model would be the use of a railroad operations simulation model to examine different combinations of track, signal, and train configurations and operating practices, with the resulting estimates of operating performance being used as the basis for a regression-based approach to establish the mathematically continuous relationships between various parameters and line capacity. Some of these relationships had only been previously addressed as discrete variables.

In addition to reflecting the contemporary characteristics of North American railroad operating practices, infrastructure, and traffic, the development of a new parametric capacity model would present the opportunity to: 1) incorporate advances in analytical techniques, 2) address areas of future research identified during the development of the 1975 model, and 3) address topics that were unable to be addressed  (or perhaps even contemplated) as part of the 1975 model due to the limitations of the analytical tools available at the time. Further, there is an opportunity to develop a software implementation of the parametric model, to allow for its user-friendly application by practitioners. No such implementation was made available for the 1975 model. 

Anticipated Budget: $950,000 to $1M.

NAICS: 541330

Responses to RFIs:

The Statement of Work is good but since this is an upgrade to the existing facilities, do you have 1-line/as-built drawings that we can use in our bid preparation?
A: Please see attached one-line drawings for existing conditions. The DWG file is the overall campus one line. The PDF shows a co-generator that was added to the campus power. There seems to be some discrepancies in the one-lines, so the AE s need to keep that in mind.

A site walk would also go a long way in assisting us with pricing.
A: No, site visit will not be provided since this is an AE Design. No fee proposal shall be needed until after evaluation has been made on the provided SF330.

Page 3 says PPQs will count towards the page limitations but there is no mention of the page limit anywhere else. Is there a page limit for the SF330 submission?
A: Size:Â  Maximum size of the e-mail message shall not exceed five (5) megabytes. Only one email is permitted unless otherwise stated in this paragraph or in writing by a Contracting Officer. Submitted SF330 s are not to exceed a total of fifty (50) pages INCLUDING cover page and any other submitted documents.

Does the VA have a list of which disciplines firms should provide resumes for in Section E?
A: Yes, see page 5 of SF 330 

Does the VA have a minimum or maximum number of projects they want firms to submit in Section F?
A: Yes, the AE should provide 3-5 relevant projects for this section.

Can you please confirm that we only need to provide VA projects awarded in the previous 12 months and the full potential value of any current indefinite delivery contracts for the prime A-E and not for our proposed subcontractors?
A: Provide the available capacity of key disciplines by providing current project workload, inclusive of all projects awarded by the VA during the previous 12 months and the full potential value of any current indefinite delivery contracts.

Can you please confirm we are not required to submit CPARS with our submission, only PPQs if CPARS are not available for the project?
A: CPARS to be submitted, if there is no CPARS data available, Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) will be accepted.

Can you please confirm that the geographical location of the firm is not an evaluation consideration of Factor 5 (Location)? Page 4 states  location in the general geographical area of the project  but then states that the intent is  not where the firm is located.  This paragraph also refers to Secondary Selection Criteria Factor 1, where information related to the firm s location is to be addressed, but there is no paragraph or subcategory for Secondary Selection Criteria in the RFQ.
A: Geographical location of the firm is not an evaluation consideration, however, intent of this factor is to showcase a firm s understanding of the site and locality, and not where the firm is located. Firm s location to be addressed is to determine what Wage Determination to extract from SAM.gov.

Would you consider cancelling this solicitation and re-issuing it through the IDIQ AE MATOC TVHS-Nashville and Murfreesboro that was awarded in September 2024? This vehicle has not yet been used to solicit responses to RFQs and seems to be a perfect fit for this project. 
A: No

Thanks for any insight you can give as to why this vehicle is not being used.
A: CONSTRUCTION BUDGET DESIGN LIMITATIONS/PROJECT MAGNITUDE: Estimated Budget Between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.

Can you please clarify if PDFs are an acceptable format for the 626A4-25-201 - 36C24925R0037 - AE Upgrade Primary Power Distribution SF330s to be submitted?Â 
A: Yes, PDFs are acceptable.

Can you please also confirm the page limitations?
A: Size:Â  Maximum size of the e-mail message shall not exceed five (5) megabytes. Only one email is permitted unless otherwise stated in this paragraph or in writing by a Contracting Officer. Submitted SF330 s are not to exceed a total of fifty (50) pages INCLUDING cover page and any other submitted documents.

f3476302d78a58ce9a504c787ce7688d-re,RFQ1769069,Navy  Readiness Support Services,"The General Services Administration (GSA), on behalf of the Navy's Naval Support Activity Bahrain, is conducting market research to identify potential contractors capable of providing readiness support services for the Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic (COMNAVSURFLANT) and Commander, Naval Surface Group Central (COMNAVSURFGRUCENT). COMNAVSURFLANT, established in 1975, plays a crucial role in consolidating various naval forces and maintaining readiness across its fleet. This command oversees more than 70 ships and numerous special mission units that operate across the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf. The support services sought are essential for maintaining operational efficiency and readiness, especially for Mine Countermeasure (MCM) and Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) deployed in Bahrain.

The contract seeks comprehensive support services that include training, management, engineering support, financial services, and data analysis. Specific tasks outlined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) include financial support through Defense Travel System administration, senior and junior metrics/data analysis focused on logistics and assessments for LCS Enginemen, maintenance scheduling coordination, engineering training facilitation, IT service desk analysis, as well as program coordination related to government travel credit card analysis. These tasks are critical for ensuring that COMNAVSURFLANT can effectively manage its operations while maintaining high standards of readiness.

Performance will occur at a government facility in Bahrain under strict security requirements. Personnel involved must possess a SECRET clearance or higher due to the classified nature of some tasks. The contractor will be responsible for managing classified materials while adhering to operational security protocols. The objective is to provide seamless support that enhances COMNAVSURFLANT's ability to man, train, equip its forces effectively.

This solicitation represents an important opportunity for contractors with expertise in defense travel systems management and naval operations support. By fulfilling these requirements efficiently and securely at an overseas location like Bahrain—while complying with anti-terrorism force protection measures—the selected contractor will contribute significantly to the strategic objectives of U.S. naval operations in key regions such as the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf.",Federal Acquisition Service,2025-07-17 00:00:00+00:00,2025-07-17,2025-07-31 17:00:00+00:00,2025-07-31,,Sources Sought,,541330,Engineering Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEDERAL ACQUISITION SERVICE,,Boston,MA,02222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,f3476302d78a58ce9a504c787ce7688d-re,,,,,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/r-RFQ1769069-re,https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/seller/prepare-quote/RFQ1769069?contractNumber=

UNAUTHORIZED COMMITMENTS 

SEP 2023




	Definitions.




Contracting Officer means a person with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make related determination and findings.



Ratification means the act of approving an unauthorized commitment by an official who has the authority to do so.



Unauthorized Commitment (UAC) means an agreement that is not binding solely because the Government representative who made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the Government.




	Policy.




The Government is not bound by agreements with, or contractual commitments made to, prospective contractors by individuals who do not have delegated contracting authority. Unauthorized commitments do not follow the appropriate process for the expenditure of Government funds. Consequently, the Government may not be able to ratify certain actions, putting a contractor at risk for taking direction from a Federal official other than the contracting officer (see FAR 1.602-1) Government employees responsible for unauthorized commitments are subject to disciplinary action. Contractors perform at their own risk when accepting direction from unauthorized officials. Failure to follow statutory and regulatory processes for the expenditure of Government funds is a very serious matter.




	Procedure.




Any agreement, modification, or change to a contractual agreement made by a government personnel who lack authority will be deemed an unauthorized commitment.  The Government is not liable to the Contractor or under the terms of the contract, financially or otherwise &ndash; unless the unauthorized commitment successfully passes the ratification process.



The ratification process does not have any lead time, nor does the Government make any promise that an unauthorized commitment will be ratified and, therefore, the Contractor would be paid.

SERT's mission involves creating computerized ship hull models to evaluate stability and structural integrity using limited information available during such emergencies.

The work being requested involves developing a parametric hull model creation tool using Rhinoceros, a 3D computer-aided design software widely used for its robust modeling capabilities. This tool aims to streamline the process of generating accurate ship models by leveraging Rhinoceros' built-in functionalities, including its Python script editor and Grasshopper algorithm editor. The contractor will be tasked with automating a rapid hull design and fairing methodology, enabling SERT to quickly produce reliable models from basic ship drawings and dimensions during time-sensitive salvage operations.

The scope of this task order includes developing, testing, and documenting this modeling tool without relying on third-party plug-ins unless they are pre-approved by the USCG. The contractor will be required to produce models for common commercial ship types, validate these models against actual hydrostatic properties, and document the entire process in a technical paper detailing methodologies, assumptions, and limitations. This initiative will significantly enhance SERT's response time and accuracy in evaluating marine casualties by providing a robust tool for generating parametric hull models with minimal user intervention.

In executing this contract on a Time and Materials basis, the selected contractor will follow specific tasks outlined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). These tasks include developing sample hulls using simplified methodologies within Rhinoceros, validating their characteristics against international guidelines for stability instruments, and building an intuitive user interface for inputting essential ship data. By fulfilling these requirements, the contractor will play a pivotal role in strengthening USCG's operational readiness during maritime emergencies.",Federal Acquisition Service,2025-07-15 00:00:00+00:00,2025-07-15,2025-07-25 17:00:00+00:00,2025-07-25,,Sources Sought,,541330,Engineering Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEDERAL ACQUISITION SERVICE,,Boston,MA,02222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47df6dee6d8c5a699ffd73d091d9e6a0-re,,,,,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/r-RFQ1768565-re,https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/seller/prepare-quote/RFQ1768565?contractNumber=

cfa7f1eb27414e29b3580efc0d120364,140802-25-0561,AOC Airplane Calibrations According to SOW,"Background

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at Lakeland, Florida, operates two Lockheed WP-3D aircraft in support of NOAA and national research.  This statement of work is to provide Evaluation, Repair, and Calibration for three Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometers (SFMR) P/N SFMR2000-P  Serial Numbers US001, US002, and US003.



The SFMR is a wing-mounted, remote sensing, scientific instrument that is flown on both NOAA WP-3D aircraft as well as each of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron&rsquo;s WC-130J aircraft. The primary function of the SFMR is to derive surface level wind speed and rain rate in the tropical cyclone environment and does so through the measurement of brightness temperatures in six frequency bands from 4.6 to 7.2 GHz. The calibrated values of brightness temperatures are processed through a windspeed retrieval algorithm in real time and the values for surface level wind speed and rain rate are then generated.



A SFMR working group consisting of subject matter experts and stakeholders from across NOAA Line Offices convened during the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season and determined that, through thorough and careful quality assurance of SFMR surface level wind data compared to that derived from other sources (i.e. dropwindsondes, satellite, NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys, etc.), SFMR brightness temperature behaviors were inconsistent leading to inconsistent SFMR surface-level wind retrievals.

***

Objective

Evaluate, repair as required, and calibrate each of the NOAA AOC SFMR units (S/N: US001, US002, and US003). Provide AOC with three serviceable SFMRs as well as a set of calibration coefficients for each SFMR that, when used, will provide surface-level wind speeds and rain rates in a tropical cyclone environment.



Scope


	Evaluate and Repair as Required, and Calibrate SFMR Serial Number US001. This work will include a full system checkup and all the necessary maintenance work to bring the SFMR back to operational specification.
	Contractor shall replace all thermistors in SFMR Serial Number US002 as well as all associated internal wiring associated with each thermistor and the applicable electronics directly involved with translating the electronics signal to counts that are used to determine thermistor temperature. All components removed and replaced to be provided to the Technical Points of Contact, listed below, along with any associated findings and reports, and thermistor schematic diagrams so that the Technical Points of Contact can further understand how these measurements are taken as they are critical to continued satisfactory performance of the instrument.
	Evaluate and Repair as Required, and Calibrate SFMR Serial Number US003. This work will include a full system checkup and all the necessary maintenance work to bring the SFMR back to operational specification.
	Once each SFMR is performing to operational specifications Vendor will also perform the lab and sky calibration of the SFMR.
	As a deliverable, Contractor will provide the SFMR raw data from the following calibration experiments:
	
		Thermal chamber at 20oC.
		Thermal chamber at 5oC.
		Sky experiment - SFMR ARU pointing at a cloudless sky (zenith).
	
	
	Calibration will include testing of all associated thermistors within the unit ensuring that the final calibration equation considers all thermistor values.
	Included in this price quote is a verification of the SFMR performance based on the data collected in a verification and calibration flight with the SFMR over a NDBC buoy or over an aircraft-deployed dropwindsonde. The verification will include a calibration flight, receive the coefficients from the Contractor, then a verification flight to ensure coefficients produce repeatable and accurate calculated values for wind speed.
	Contractor shall finally release the agreed upon calibration coefficients to the latest SFMR4.cfg configuration file used by the Aircraft Operations Center.
	Shipping of unit back to the AOC to be billed to NOAA AOC UPS Shipping Account; W81V41.
	Work to be accomplished on each SFMR by 31 December 2025.
	Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, and special tools to complete the repair and calibration. All work shall be in accordance with applicable maintenance manuals.

Performance Requirements




	Technical Points of Contact (listed below) will be consulted and provided opportunities to do joint analysis and provide input during the diagnoses, repair, testing, and calibration activities for each SFMR unit.
	The causes of brightness temperature anomalous behavior for each unit needs to be satisfactorily understood by the Technical Points of Contact (listed below) and a mitigation approach to resolve these behaviors agreed upon prior to the return and acceptance of each SFMR unit by AOC.
	The Technical Points of Contact will be provided the raw lab calibration measurements for independent processing and analysis utilizing the SFMR reprocessing software.
	Technical Points of Contact, and personnel deemed appropriate and necessary by the Technical Points of Contact, may visit the Vendor&rsquo;s facility to better facilitate collaboration on analysis and testing of the SFMR units. Travel and incurred expenses for visitation would be at the expense of traveling personnel.
	Vendor will characterize:
	
		Individual SFMR unit temperature performance from -47oC to +35oC.
		
			Characterization should include adjusting the temperature from low to high (heating up) and high to low (cooling down) since components might behave differently depending upon the temperature change direction (hysteresis).
			The Contractor will perform a thermal chamber time vs. temperature cycle test that covers the above temperatures. This time vs. temperature profile will be determined in conjunction with the Technical Points of Contact listed below and must be approved by the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative (COR) prior to the start of testing.
		
		
		Individual SFMR unit brightness temperature stability with time.
		
			This should include brightness temperature stabilization time dependent on temperature (i.e. Vendor&rsquo;s prescribed wait time at each altitude during calibration flights).
			Vendor will prescribe acclimation time period prior to collection of mission data or how long recovery will take if passing through very warm/very cold regions along the flight track.
			Vendor will determine if a 10 minute acclimation period at mission altitude is sufficient for all high altitude regimes or if a different approach is warranted.
		
		
		SFMR unit-to-unit and channel-to-channel intercalibration.
		
			Ensure consistent performance of each SFMR unit to one another and consistent spreading of channels between each unit, which is necessary to obtain consistent and accurate wind speed and rain rate retrievals.
		
		
		Frequency drift error with voltage control oscillator error.
	
	
	The Contractor shall verify the serviceability and operational stability of the microprocessor-based thermal control device integrated within each SFMR unit.
	
		The Contractor shall provide empirical evidence that confirms proper thermal regulation, including:
		
			A graph of thermistor readings from the heated radome or enclosure, showing how temperature changes over time.
			A representative sample of electrical current draw while the heater is active (such as during startup or a cold-soak condition).
			The data should clearly show heater activation, thermal response time, and whether the system cycles on/off as expected.
		
		
	
	
	Within 10 calendar days of contract award, the Contractor shall provide the Government with the following for review and approval:
	
		A Minimum Performance Specification that defines the key parameters used to evaluate each SFMR.
		An Acceptance Test Procedure or Test Sheet outlining test steps, expected results, and pass/fail criteria.
	
	
	These documents must be approved by the COR before any SFMR evaluations begin.
	Final performance data and test results for each SFMR shall be delivered with the unit, and should reference the approved test documentation used during evaluation.

STATEMENT OF NEED

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)

NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) OFFICE OF OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH (OAR) CHEMICAL SCIENCES LABORATORY (CSL)





PURPOSE:

The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory Tropospheric Chemistry Group (CSL7) requires the purchase of specially manufactured components to build 12 aircraft-certified racks that will be used for housing instrumentation.  The aircraft-certified instrument racks are mission-critical equipment for the upcoming AiRMAPS (Airborne and Remote sensing Multi Air Pollutant Surveys) field campaign. NOAA CSL7 has already worked with the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, to create a rack design that is pre-approved for NOAA aircraft (such as the P-3) . All parts must meet exact technical specifications, specific machining standards, must be composed of specific aluminum alloys, and must be able to withstand 5G forces.  NOAA CSL7 now needs to purchase enough parts for 12 aircraft instrument racks, which will then be subsequently assembled at the lab, and then deployed on NOAA aircraft during the AiRMAPS field campaign which is projected to continue into 2028.  Inability to purchase these materials would compromise both immediate and far-reaching mission objectives to survey air pollutants across the United States. The aircraft rack components will be delivered within 4 weeks after purchase.



SCOPE OR MISSION:

The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory performs state-of-the-art air quality measurements to support forecasting models, inform air quality manager decision making, and conduct cutting-edge research. This could not be accomplished without the custom instrumentation designed, built, and deployed by NOAA CSL7 on aircraft during large-scale field campaigns (such as AiRMAPS) to survey and do chemical measurements on the atmosphere across urban and rural areas of the United States.



BACKGROUND:

The current inventory of aircraft racks used for NOAA CSL7 missions no longer meet certifications to fly on NOAA aircraft, as well as on other platforms operated by research partners, such as NASA and NSF. Scientific instruments deployed during field missions must be securely housed in aircraft-certified racks that can withstand the significant forces and maneuvering that occur during flight. NOAA CSL7 has worked with both the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL to design a new instrument rack prototype that has been demonstrated to meet aircraft rack certification standards and fulfill mission requirements. A quantity of 12 such aircraft racks are needed for housing scientific instrumentation in order to conduct in-flight measurements and surveys during the upcoming AiRMAPS field campaign.  Therefore, this purchase order request will provide the numerous specialized components required for assembling the 12 aircraft racks ahead of deploying them during upcoming field missions.



TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:


	Rack components have been designed by Pagnotta Engineering and have been approved by NOAA Aircraft Operations (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, for flight on the NOAA P-3 aircraft. All parts must meet exact technical specifications to ISO 9001:2015 machining standards.
	All parts must be composed of aluminum alloys 6061 or 7075.

STATEMENT OF NEED
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)
NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) OFFICE OF OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH (OAR) CHEMICAL SCIENCES LABORATORY (CSL)
PURPOSE:
The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory Tropospheric Chemistry Group (CSL7) requires the purchase of specially manufactured components to build 12 aircraft-certified racks that will be used for housing instrumentation. The aircraft-certified instrument racks are mission-critical equipment for the upcoming AiRMAPS (Airborne and Remote sensing Multi Air Pollutant Surveys) field campaign. NOAA CSL7 has already worked with the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, to create a rack design that is pre-approved for NOAA aircraft (such as the P-3) . All parts must meet exact technical specifications, specific machining standards, must be composed of specific aluminum alloys, and must be able to withstand 5G forces. NOAA CSL7 now needs to purchase enough parts for 12 aircraft instrument racks,
which will then be subsequently assembled at the lab, and then deployed on NOAA aircraft during the AiRMAPS field campaign which is projected to continue into 2028. Inability to purchase these materials would compromise both immediate and far-reaching mission objectives to survey air pollutants across the United States. The aircraft rack components will be delivered within 4 weeks after purchase.
SCOPE OR MISSION:
The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory performs state-of-the-art air quality measurements to support forecasting models, inform air quality manager decision making, and conduct cutting-edge research. This could not be accomplished without the custom instrumentation designed, built, and deployed by NOAA CSL7 on aircraft during large-scale field campaigns (such as AiRMAPS) to survey and do chemical measurements on the atmosphere across urban and rural areas of the United States.
BACKGROUND:
The current inventory of aircraft racks used for NOAA CSL7 missions no longer meet certifications to fly on NOAA aircraft, as well as on other platforms operated by research partners, such as NASA and NSF. Scientific instruments deployed during field missions must be securely housed in aircraft-certified racks that can withstand the significant forces and maneuvering that occur during flight. NOAA CSL7 has worked with both the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL to design a new instrument rack prototype that has been demonstrated to meet aircraft rack certification standards and fulfill mission requirements. A quantity of 12 such aircraft racks are needed for housing scientific instrumentation in order to conduct in-flight measurements and surveys during the upcoming AiRMAPS field campaign. Therefore, this purchase order request will provide the numerous specialized components required for assembling the 12 aircraft racks ahead of deploying them during upcoming field missions.
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
1. Rack components have been designed by Pagnotta Engineering and have been approved by NOAA Aircraft Operations (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, for flight on the NOAA P-3 aircraft. All parts must meet exact technical specifications to ISO 9001:2015 machining standards.
2. All parts must be composed of aluminum alloys 6061 or 7075.

One-Year Subscription of Jeppesen Publications Subscription (Annual)

for

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center (AOC)





Background

The Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, requires navigational database subscriptions for its fleet of eight aircraft. To maintain consistency, all subscription invoices will be prorated to ensure a unified period of performance ending on July 2, 2026. Renewing these subscriptions is essential for enhancing flight safety and situational awareness among aircrew members. The database provides access to up-to-date navigational charts for all airports within AOC&rsquo;s operational area, enabling crews to effectively brief and execute actions across all phases of flight.



Updates are provided by purchasing an annual subscription. As only one company provides the required database updates for Jeppesen navigational charts, it is recommended that the government purchases this product for all eight aircraft directly from Jeppesen - A Boeing Company.



Requirements



The purpose of this order is to renew the one-year subscription for Jepessen charts used within various aircraft avionics for navigation during flight for missions conducted at AOC.



Delivery Date

NOAA requires the database subscription for the time period of  July 2, 2025 through July 3, 2026. Delivery and installation of subscription is required by Jun 30, 2025.

The associated NAICS code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,250 employees.  (v)	This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial items:CLIN 0001Purchase of specialized components required for assembling the 12 aircraft racks in accordance with the Statement of Need. Deliver within 4 weeks after date of award.All offered products must meet the requirements of Buy American-Supplies to be considered. Provide verification of country of manufacture for offered products.(vi)	Description of requirements is as follows:See attached Statement of Need STATEMENT OF NEEDDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) OFFICE OF OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH (OAR) CHEMICAL SCIENCES LABORATORY (CSL)PURPOSE:The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory Tropospheric Chemistry Group (CSL7) requires the purchase of specially manufactured components to build 12 aircraft-certified racks that will be used for housing instrumentation.  The aircraft-certified instrument racks are mission-critical equipment for the upcoming AiRMAPS (Airborne and Remote sensing Multi Air Pollutant Surveys) field campaign. NOAA CSL7 has already worked with the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, to create a rack design that is pre-approved for NOAA aircraft (such as the P-3) . All parts must meet exact technical specifications, specific machining standards, must be composed of specific aluminum alloys, and must be able to withstand 5G forces.  NOAA CSL7 now needs to purchase enough parts for 12 aircraft instrument racks, which will then be subsequently assembled at the lab, and then deployed on NOAA aircraft during the AiRMAPS field campaign which is projected to continue into 2028.  Inability to purchase these materials would compromise both immediate and far-reaching mission objectives to survey air pollutants across the United States. The aircraft rack components will be delivered within 4 weeks after purchase.SCOPE OR MISSION:The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory performs state-of-the-art air quality measurements to support forecasting models, inform air quality manager decision making, and conduct cutting-edge research. This could not be accomplished without the custom instrumentation designed, built, and deployed by NOAA CSL7 on aircraft during large-scale field campaigns (such as AiRMAPS) to survey and do chemical measurements on the atmosphere across urban and rural areas of the United States.BACKGROUND:The current inventory of aircraft racks used for NOAA CSL7 missions no longer meet certifications to fly on NOAA aircraft, as well as on other platforms operated by research partners, such as NASA and NSF. Scientific instruments deployed during field missions must be securely housed in aircraft-certified racks that can withstand the significant forces and maneuvering that occur during flight. NOAA CSL7 has worked with both the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL to design a new instrument rack prototype that has been demonstrated to meet aircraft rack certification standards and fulfill mission requirements. A quantity of 12 such aircraft racks are needed for housing scientific instrumentation in order to conduct in-flight measurements and surveys during the upcoming AiRMAPS field campaign.  Therefore, this purchase order request will provide the numerous specialized components required for assembling the 12 aircraft racks ahead of deploying them during upcoming field missions.TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:1.	Rack components have been designed by Pagnotta Engineering and have been approved by NOAA Aircraft Operations (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, for flight on the NOAA P-3 aircraft. All parts must meet exact technical specifications to ISO 9001:2015 machining standards.2.	All parts must be composed of aluminum alloys 6061 or 7075.SHIP TO ADDRESS:To: DOC/NOAA/CSLAttn: Matthew Coggon 325 Broadway MC:R/CSL7 Room 1A 104Boulder, Colorado USA 80305SHIP USING: Shipping is covered by vendor(vii)	Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance:Deliver within 4 weeks after date of award.Delivery shall be FOB Destination to  325 Broadway MC:R/CSL7 Room 1A 104Boulder, Colorado USA 80305(viii) FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Products and Commercial Services (Sept 2023), applies to this acquisition and can be found on the Request for Quote form SF18 attachment.(ix) FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Products and Commercial Services (Nov 2021), applies to this acquisition and can be found on the Request for Quote form SF18 attachment.(x) FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Products and Commercial Services (May 2024) (Deviation 2025-02)  (Deviation 2025-03) (Feb 2025), applies to this acquisition and can be found on the Request for Quote form SF18 attachment.

In alignment with recent Executive Orders, the Department conducted a thorough analysis of active contract awards and solicitations to assess mission-criticality and continued needs. As a result of the analysis and findings, PACTS III was determined to be a non-mission critical contract that would provide redundant offerings available through existing General Services Administration (GSA) solutions. Therefore, in alignment with Executive Order 14240 &ldquo;Eliminating Waste and Saving Taxpayer Dollars by Consolidating Procurement&rdquo;, which calls for the consolidation of Federal procurement for common goods and services under GSA solutions, the Department is taking action to cancel the solicitation. The Department intends to leverage existing contract solutions such as GSA&rsquo;s One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services+ and the GSA Multiple Award Schedules to support its requirements for these services in the future.

The Department would like to thank the offerors who participated in the solicitation process.

3/12/2025 Update: The Government is still evaluating proposals that were received in response to this solicitation. The date of anticipated award will be announced once it is established.

12/9/2024 Update: The Government is still evaluating proposals that were received in response to this solicitation. The date of anticipated award will be announced once it is established.

10/10/2024 Update: The Government is still evaluating proposals that were received in response to this solicitation. The date of anticipated award will be announced once it is established.

8/27/2024 Update: Per the addendum to solicitation provision 52.212-1, paragraph 1.2, the Government anticipated awarding PACTS III in August 2024. The Government will not be awarding PACTS III in August 2024 and a new date of award has not yet been determined. Once the Government has a date it anticipates awarding PACTS III, we will post it on sam.gov.

5/29/2024 &ndash; Update: Questions 726-729 and the responses were inadvertently omitted from the list of Questions and Answers from Amendment 5 so they have been included and posted to sam.gov. These additional questions can be accessed by clicking on the attachment titled &ldquo;PACTS III Solicitation Questions and Answers 05_21_24_Additional Questions&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Attachments/Links&rdquo; section of this posting. These additional questions and responses will not be incorporated via an amendment. All proposals are due no later than May 31, 2024 by 5:00:00pm ET.  

5/23/2024- Update: Amendment 0005 to 70SBUR24R00000003 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page and Part IV &ndash; Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation and to incorporate questions and answers.

Offeror&#39;s must acknowledge all five amendments in order for its proposal to be acceptable. All amendments issued to the solicitations apply to all Offerors regardless if they are new or have provided a proposal already; therefore, all Offerors must acknowledge them in some way.

If the Offeror is providing a new proposal or chooses to resubmit their proposal, per addendum to 52.212-1, para. 6.0 they are required to either check the box in PIEE that confirms the Offeror acknowledges all the amendments or they shall provide all the SF30s signed with their proposal in PIEE to reflect their acknowledgement. Per Amendments 0003-0005, if the Offeror chooses to keep the proposal it already submitted, it must send the signed SF 30s for each amendment to PACTSIII@uscis.dhs.gov no later than 5:00pm (5:00:00pm) ET on May 31, 2024. Additionally, the Offeror must state in its email that its original proposal or the one provided in response to Amendment 0003 (whichever one its validating) will remain valid from the time the email is sent to the period stated in its original Volume I cover sheet, Attachment 16. Acknowledging the amendments is the Offeror&#39;s admission that it understands the content of the amendments and that their proposal has taken the amendments into account and its proposal is in compliance with all the amendments. If the Offeror revalidated its original proposal by providing a signed SF30 via email in response to Amendment 0003, it only needs to send the SF30s for Amendment 0004 and 0005 via email if it chooses to continue to keep the proposal it originally submitted.

Additionally, we recommend Offerors begin submitting their proposals sooner rather than later in PIEE. If Offerors have issues with PIEE, please call the PIEE help desk as soon as possible.

Lastly, to gain access to the solicitation and all the amendments that have been issued, Contractors shall click on the &ldquo;PIEE Solicitation Module Link for 70SBUR24R0000000X&rdquo; below. This will take Contractors to the solicitation in PIEE. Once there, scroll to the bottom and each amendment will be at the bottom of the page. To access each amendment, click on the amendment number highlighted in blue. To locate the solicitation with the changes, Offerors must scroll to the bottom and click the attachments within the amendment.

5/21/2024 &ndash; Update: Amendment 0004 to 70SBUR24R00000003 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, and Part IV &ndash; Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date).

5/20/2024 Update:

Clarity is being provided as to what &ldquo;if applicable&rdquo; means in the addendum to 52.212-1, paragraph 4.3.1.2.2(f) in the statement &ldquo;contract number and line item (if applicable)&ldquo;.

The intent of including &ldquo;if applicable&rdquo; after &ldquo;contract number and line item&rdquo; was meant to state, if the contract number and line item is available. To clarify this further, the DHS recognizes that including the contract number on a invoice and/or proof of payment may not be standard practice; therefore, the contract number may not be included on the invoice and/or proof of payment. If the contract number is missing from the invoice and/or proof of payment, the invoice and/or proof of payment will be acceptable forms of supporting documentation if the DHS is able to confirm the invoice and/or proof of payment provided is for the project/contract being claimed.

Amendment 0003 to 70SBUR24R00000003 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part II - Contract Clauses, Part III &ndash; Terms and Conditions and Attachments, and Part IV &ndash; Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date)

5/8/2024 Update:

The DHS intends on amending this solicitation, no later than May 10, 2024, to include the following updates:


	The addendums to 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 will be updated to allow Offerors that have Non-Federal projects and projects performed as a First-Tier subcontractor to submit paid invoices as means to substantiate the obligated amounts claimed.
	The addendum to 52.212-1, paragraph 4.3.1.2.1(d)(ii) will be updated to clarify what it means when an Offeror includes the NAICS code/Product Service Code on the Project Verification Form.
	The addendums to 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 will be updated to clarify what &ldquo;at the time of&rdquo; means as it relates to an adequate accounting system and acceptable facility clearance.
	Minor administrative corrections


As a result of these updates, Contractors may, but are not required to, submit a full proposal in response to the Amendment 0003 no later than 5pm (5:00:00 pm) ET on May 21, 2024.

If a contractor has already provided a proposal and it chooses to update/modify or add to their existing proposal, it must resubmit its proposal in PIEE in its entirety. However, if the Offeror chooses to keep the proposal it already submitted, it must send the signed SF 30 from Amendment 0003 to PACTSIII@uscis.dhs.gov no later than 5pm (5:00:00 pm) ET on May 21, 2024. Additionally, the Offeror must state in its email that its original proposal will remain valid from the time the email is sent to the period stated in its original Volume I cover sheet. If you did not submit a proposal or your proposal was provided after exactly 5:00pm (5:00:00 pm) Friday, April 12, 2024, you may submit a proposal no later than 5pm (5:00:00pm) ET on Tuesday, May 21, 2024.

We highly recommend Offerors take this opportunity to review the proposals they submitted to ensure all required documents have been submitted and the Offeror used the Self-Scoring Sheet that corresponds to the Functional Category/ Solicitation the Offeror is proposing.

If a Contractor chooses to submit a new or revised proposal, only include documents in the designated areas in the PIEE Offer Template. DO NOT include any documents in the catch-all &ldquo;Attachments&rdquo; area (after Volume IV) at the bottom of the template. Not abiding by this may result in a non-complaint proposal. Also, ensure you submit the correct versions of the Volume I Cover Sheet (Amendment 0001) and Project Cover Sheets (Amendments 0001 or 0002) when resubmitting. Lastly, please include a log of all changes/updates that were made between the original proposal submitted and the revised proposal in the &ldquo;Proposal Table of Contents&rdquo; folder in the PIEE template.

If Contractors already provided a proposal and included documents in the &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; or submitted the incorrect Volume I or Project Cover Sheets, they do not need to resubmit only to fix this error. However, if Contractors are providing new or revised proposals, we ask that they please abide by the instructions provided above.

4/12/2024 Update (Correction):

There were errors made in the responses to questions 682, 692 and 696. Corrections to these questions have been made and are highlighted in red in the attached. 

4/12/2024: Proposal are due no later than April 12, 2024 at 5pm ET as stated in Amendment 0002. A request for an extension will not be granted.

Attached are our responses to some of the questions (675 &ndash; 700) that we have received. We are not incorporating these into an amendment since it would cause Offerors that have already submitted proposals in PIEE to completely redo their proposals.

4/9/2024: Proposal are due no later than April 12, 2024 at 5pm ET as stated in Amendment 0002. A request for an extension will not be granted.

Attached are our responses to some of the questions (644 &ndash; 674) that we have received. We are not incorporating these into an amendment since it would cause Offerors that have already submitted proposals in PIEE to completely redo their proposals.

Additionally, it is our understanding that when files are saved and uploaded into the PIEE system that the special characters associated with the naming conventions required in Attachment 9 may not appear. Please continue to abide by the naming conventions required in Attachment 9. If the special characters are replaced with &ldquo;_&rdquo; or are omitted when the files are saved or uploaded to PIEE, Offerors will not be deemed non-compliant. However, Offerors must continue to abide by the naming conventions required in Attachment 9 regardless of this issue.

3/28/2024 - Update Amendment 0002 to 70SBUR24R00000003 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part II - Contract Clauses, Part III &ndash; Terms and Conditions and Attachments, and Part IV &ndash; Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date), update the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) Offer Template and incorporate the questions and answers.

If you have started to submit or have submitted your offer, you should receive an email notification stating that a new amendment has been issued. Please ensure you acknowledge receipt of all amendments, including Amendment 0002 and include this acknowledgment in your final offer.

It has been brought to our attention that an issue has been identified where the amendment section does not display as expected when clicking the public posting link included with the notice on SAM.gov. The display issue affects how users access and view amendments after clicking the public posting link or the ability to download all attachments. In the interim, users are advised to perform a search using the solicitation number. The search can be done in the public portal (https://piee.eb.mil/sol/xhtml/unauth/index.xhtml) or the secure portal (registered users with an active Solicitation Module role can login into PIEE and click the Solicitation Module button). For guidance on how to search the public portal, users can follow the guide linked below: https://rise.articulate.com/share/g-eLRgthQ4e15c_9yx9wqiqqPRfJFxS3#/ Additional resources are available by clicking Training and Resources on the Documentation dropdown in the public and secure portal.

Lastly, the PACTS III Team is no longer accepting questions pertaining to the PACTS III solicitations.

3/20/2024 - Update

The PACTS III team is continuing to work through the questions submitted in response to the solicitations and will have them posted to sam.gov soon. The DHS will be issuing an Amendment 0002 to the solicitations which will incorporate the questions and responses as well as updates to the solicitations and a few attachments. Due to the unexpected delay in getting this information to the public, we do intend on extending the proposal response date which will be provided in the Amendment 0002 to the solicitations.

2/29/2024 

The PACTS III team has received 500+ questions in response to the solicitations. Once we have answered all the questions, we will post them to sam.gov. 

Additionally, it has been brought to our attention that the the amendment section of this posting is not displaying and it is making it difficult for the public to view Amendment 0001. The team is working hard to fix this issue; however, in the meantime, you can access the Amendment 0001 by clicking on the &quot;PIEE Solicitation Module Link for 70SBUR24R00000003&quot; and then &quot;Download All Attachments&quot; at the bottom of the screen. Contractors may also gain access to Amendment 0001 by logging into PIEE, searching the solicitation and scrolling to the bottom of the page. 

2/13/2024 

Amendment 0001 to 70SBUR24R0000003 has been issued to make changes to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part III, Request for Proposal Attachments, Part IV, Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 of the solicitation and the Offer Template in PIEE.

The suite of Program Management, Administrative, Clerical, and Technical Services (PACTS) III Department-wide Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts are intended to provide program management, administrative, clerical, technical, and engineering commercial services and solutions that will enable the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to accomplish its mission objectives. The goals of PACTS III are to provide the Department and its Components a mechanism for quick ordering of professional services and solutions at fair and reasonable prices, to give qualified small businesses a greater opportunity to participate in these requirements, and to assist the Department with continuing to achieve and exceed its small business and socioeconomic goals. The Statement of Work (SOW), Attachment 1 which delineates the details of the services and solutions is composed of three comprehensive Functional Categories (FCs) of commercial services. The three FCs have a primary NAICS code that further describes the scope of work that will be procured under each FC. All three of the FCs have specific requirements that will be further identified and defined at the Task Order (TO) level).  The FC and associated NAICS codes are as follows: FC1: Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services: NAICS Code: 541611; FC2: Office Administrative Services; NAICS Code: 561110; FC3: Engineering Services; NAICS Code: 541330. The DHS anticipates including four, separate and distinct tracks under each FC for the following socioeconomic groups: Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) and 8(a) businesses. This solicitation, 70SBUR24R00000003, is for FC3: Engineering Services: NAICS Code: 541330. This acquisition has been set-aside for SDVOSB, WOSB, HUBZone and 8(a) businesses only; therefore, only these types of businesses may provide a proposal in response to this solicitation.

Key personnel shall be permanent employees of the prime firm/team rather than temporary &ldquo;contract hire&rdquo; employee arrangements. Failure to provide a balanced workforce in the disciplines listed could result in the firm being considered not qualified. The combination of criteria below will be used to determine the ability of the staff to contribute to the successful completion of project task orders. Firms with greater breadth of in-house expertise will be rated higher than those needing to hire sub-consultants. The offeror&rsquo;s team shall include staff members found in the statement of work (SOW) in the following disciplines:




	Cost Estimator
	Fire Protection Engineer
	Fire Protection Technician Staff/ CAD Drafter

&bull; Example Projects: Submit example design projects in narrative format that highlight the experience factors listed above. Design project examples should not exceed two pages each. All experience factors do not have to be included in a single project. The offeror may submit multiple projects to demonstrate experience in all relevant types of work, however, do not submit more than five projects total..

In addition, and if known,



b) Example projects may be from the private or public sector; however, VA projects may be rated higher. Projects completed more recently will be evaluated more advantageously. The design of all example projects must have been completed within the past four (4) years (prior to the SF-330 due date for this solicitation). The evaluation will consider the relevancy (design and, size and location) of projects identified. For the purposes of this evaluation the A-E may submit no more than two example projects which were investigations or studies only. The investigation(s) or study(ies) must have been completed within the past four (4) years (prior to the SF-330 due date for this solicitation) as well.



c) Examples of work submitted that do not meet the requirements specified here will not be evaluated. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified and eliminated from further consideration.

work within the prime and among any teaming partners. Teaming partners to be included by the prime firm in their response should be clearly identified as such for evaluation purposes and will later be agreed to during

negotiations of any resultant contract. SF-330, Part II, Block 11 will also be evaluated to assist in determining this factor. SF-330 Part I Blocks C, D, F and SF-330, Part II will also be evaluated to support this criterion. NCO 23

will consider any information which may be pertinent to this criterion, including the following:



&bull; Capacity to perform work in-house and with teaming members.

&bull; Demonstrate active on-going Federal and Non-Federal work (Address current dollar value of work, number

of current projects, management approach to your on-going work, and how the team will support the work requirements outlined in this synopsis in addition to current work).

9e363177ecca452fa1e62e8cdb15263e,S-167573,TECHNOLOGY LICENSING OPPORTUNITY - Spacecraft Speedometer: Satellite Velocity Detection,"The Spacecraft Speedometer provides real-time velocity measurements for satellites without relying on GPS, which can be unreliable at low altitudes, in high-radiation environments and during geomagnetic storms. The technology has been successfully tested in space and is ready for scaling and commercialization. We are seeking a manufacturing partner or system integrator to refine production and deploy this technology into commercial and defense satellite markets.

How it Works: 

Using a dual-sensor head electrostatic analyzer (ESA), it determines velocity by analyzing ambient space plasma charged particles, offering a self-contained, compact, and power-efficient solution for better orbital tracking and space weather monitoring. Designed as a small size, weight, and power (SWaP) payload for small satellite platforms, this system fills a critical gap in spacecraft navigation, improving operational efficiency while reducing reliance on external tracking systems. As spacecraft and probes travel to planets and moons where GPS isn&rsquo;t available, the Spacecraft Speedometer provides a critical navigation solution for deep-space missions. By enabling precise velocity measurements in these GPS-denied environments, it supports autonomous spacecraft operations, improves mission planning, and ensures accurate trajectory control for planetary exploration and interplanetary travel.

Key Advantages: 


	Velocity Measurement: Directly measures spacecraft speed in situ, improving orbit prediction and maneuver planning.
	Compact &amp; Low-Power Design: Optimized for CubeSats and small satellites, making it cost-effective and scalable.
	Enhanced Space Weather Monitoring: Provides real-time data to mitigate space weather disruptions that impact spacecraft performance.
	Increased Accuracy for Satellite Tracking: Reduces reliance on GPS, which struggles at low altitudes and certain latitudes, especially during intense space weather events.
	Space Deployment: Successfully tested on the International Space Station (ISS), validating its accuracy


Problems Solved: 


	Unlike traditional satellite velocity tracking, which relies on GPS or ground-based radar, the Spacecraft Speedometer provides direct, onboard velocity measurements using a dual-sensor laminated-head electrostatic analyzer (ESA). This system detects and analyzes charged particles in space, filtering them based on energy and trajectory to
	determine spacecraft velocity in real time.
	The laminated-head design enhances measurement accuracy and efficiency by optimizing particle detection and reducing noise. Because it does not depend on external signals, it remains effective in GPS-limited environments, such as low-altitude or high-radiation regions.
	Its compact, low-power design makes it well-suited for CubeSats, small satellites, and larger spacecraft, improving orbital prediction and mission planning while reducing reliance on external tracking systems.


Market Applications: 


	Small Satellite &amp; CubeSat Operators: Enhances tracking for satellites where GPS is unreliable.
	Space Weather Monitoring &amp; Forecasting: Provides critical velocity data to predict space weather disruptions.
	Government &amp; Defense Agencies: Supports space domain awareness and collision avoidance.
	Satellite Manufacturers &amp; System Integrators: Can be easily integrated into commercial and defense satellite systems.


With the space weather forecasting market projected to grow to $2.8B by 2032, this technology offers a low-cost, scalable alternative to traditional tracking methods, enabling more autonomous, cost-effective space operations.

STATEMENT OF NEED

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)

NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) OFFICE OF OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH (OAR) CHEMICAL SCIENCES LABORATORY (CSL)





PURPOSE:

The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory Tropospheric Chemistry Group (CSL7) requires the purchase of specially manufactured components to build 12 aircraft-certified racks that will be used for housing instrumentation.  The aircraft-certified instrument racks are mission-critical equipment for the upcoming AiRMAPS (Airborne and Remote sensing Multi Air Pollutant Surveys) field campaign. NOAA CSL7 has already worked with the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, to create a rack design that is pre-approved for NOAA aircraft (such as the P-3) . All parts must meet exact technical specifications, specific machining standards, must be composed of specific aluminum alloys, and must be able to withstand 5G forces.  NOAA CSL7 now needs to purchase enough parts for 12 aircraft instrument racks, which will then be subsequently assembled at the lab, and then deployed on NOAA aircraft during the AiRMAPS field campaign which is projected to continue into 2028.  Inability to purchase these materials would compromise both immediate and far-reaching mission objectives to survey air pollutants across the United States. The aircraft rack components will be delivered within 4 weeks after purchase.



SCOPE OR MISSION:

The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory performs state-of-the-art air quality measurements to support forecasting models, inform air quality manager decision making, and conduct cutting-edge research. This could not be accomplished without the custom instrumentation designed, built, and deployed by NOAA CSL7 on aircraft during large-scale field campaigns (such as AiRMAPS) to survey and do chemical measurements on the atmosphere across urban and rural areas of the United States.



BACKGROUND:

The current inventory of aircraft racks used for NOAA CSL7 missions no longer meet certifications to fly on NOAA aircraft, as well as on other platforms operated by research partners, such as NASA and NSF. Scientific instruments deployed during field missions must be securely housed in aircraft-certified racks that can withstand the significant forces and maneuvering that occur during flight. NOAA CSL7 has worked with both the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL to design a new instrument rack prototype that has been demonstrated to meet aircraft rack certification standards and fulfill mission requirements. A quantity of 12 such aircraft racks are needed for housing scientific instrumentation in order to conduct in-flight measurements and surveys during the upcoming AiRMAPS field campaign.  Therefore, this purchase order request will provide the numerous specialized components required for assembling the 12 aircraft racks ahead of deploying them during upcoming field missions.



TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:


	Rack components have been designed by Pagnotta Engineering and have been approved by NOAA Aircraft Operations (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, for flight on the NOAA P-3 aircraft. All parts must meet exact technical specifications to ISO 9001:2015 machining standards.
	All parts must be composed of aluminum alloys 6061 or 7075.

The three most highly rated firms based on the technical review of all the SF 330&rsquo;s received will be notified.  A solicitation will only be issued to the most highly qualified firm at conclusion of the technical review. The second and third place rated firms will be notified that they were not selected most qualified but that they may still be contacted for solicitation if award does not proceed with the most highly qualified firm.



Submission Requirements: Firms must provide a customer reference list with addresses and telephone numbers, and bidding records (AE Estimate Cost of Construction vs. Construction Awarded Amount), if applicable for all projects listed as related experience, and a project workload schedule showing proposed team members for the project period. All responding firms, including consultants to the primary firm are required to submit their SF 330 Part 1 and Part 2 electronically to both the contracting officer and contracting Specialist. Contracting Officer: Dwayne Brauch / Email Address: dwayne.brauch@va.gov . The SF 330, Part I, must clearly indicate the office location where the work will be performed, the qualifications of the individuals and subcontractors proposed to work on the contract, and their geographical location.

You must submit your electronic copy and any supplemental information (such as spreadsheets, backup data, and technical information), using any of the electronic formats and media described below. However, contractors will be notified of the award via an electronic Notice of Award e-mail.  The award document will be attached to the Notice of Award e-mail. Acceptable Electronic Formats (Software) for Submission of SF 330 packages:


	Files readable using the current Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). When submitting construction drawings, contractors are required to submit one set in AutoCAD and one set in Adobe PDF. (Purpose: contracting can open the PDF version, and engineering can open AutoCAD files).

	SF 330s shall be provided on standard letter size 8-1/2 by 11-inch paper, limited to a maximum of seventy-five (75), single-sided, single-spaced, and numbered pages. If more than seventy-five (75) single-sided pages are submitted, all pages after seventy-five (75) pages will not be evaluated. The font for text shall be Times New Roman 12-point or larger.





	Please note that we can no longer accept .zip files due to increasing security concerns.




EVALUATION CRITERIA:

Each firm must demonstrate their qualifications with respect to the selection criteria listed below. Evaluation criteria (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) are of equal importance; criterion (F) is of lesser importance than criteria (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E); and criterion (G) is of least importance and will be used as a tiebreaker among technically equal firms. SF-330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm/team based on submitted SF-330 responses. Failure to provide requested data or comply with the instructions in this synopsis and SF-330 instructions could result in a firm considered being less qualified or eliminated from consideration. Specific evaluation criteria include:



A. Professional qualifications:

SF-330, Part I, Block E. NCO 23 will consider any information, which may be pertinent to this criterion, including the following: proposed key personnel (reference primary discipline list below), professional registration, and competence, related experiences to accomplish this work, education, and years with the company. Key personnel shall be permanent employees of the prime firm/team rather than temporary &ldquo;contract hire&rdquo; employee arrangements. Failure to provide a balanced workforce in the disciplines listed could result in the firm being considered not qualified. The combination of criteria below will be used to determine the ability of the staff to contribute to the successful completion of project task orders. Firms with greater breadth of in-house expertise will be rated higher than those needing to hire sub-consultants. The offeror&rsquo;s team shall include staff members licensed in the States covering Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISN) 23 found in the statement of work (SOW) in the following disciplines:

&bull; Architectural Design

&bull; Structural Engineer*

&bull; Mechanical Engineer

&bull; Electrical Engineer

&bull; Cost Estimator

&bull; Commissioning Agent

In addition, the offeror&rsquo;s team shall include staff members in the following disciplines and shall demonstrate their qualification:

&bull; Project/Program Manager

&bull; Construction Management

&bull; Quality Control Manager



B. Specialized experience and technical competence:

SF-330, Part I, Section F. Region 3 NCO 23 will consider any information which may be pertinent to this criterion, including the following: specialized experience and technical competence in the performance of services similar to those anticipated under this contract in terms of recent and relevant experience with regard to the project examples described below, as well as demonstrated experience with VA facility design.

&bull; Example Projects: Submit example design projects in narrative format that highlight the experience factors listed above. Design project examples should not exceed two pages each. All experience factors do not have to be included in a single project. The offeror may submit multiple projects to demonstrate experience in all relevant types of work, however, do not submit more than five projects total

a) The narratives of example projects should show contract number, issuing agency, project name, a current point of contact including telephone and email information, project scope, size, location, design fees, the total number of modifications / change orders issued during performance of project, date of project completion, estimate of construction cost, principal design elements and features, complexity of the job, challenges faced to include disagreements regarding design requirements and construction estimates disputes, and the resolution and results of any challenges faced. In addition, and if known, list the construction contract award price, and the total number of construction contract modifications/change orders and their total value.

b) Example projects may be from the private or public sector; however, VA projects may be rated higher. Projects completed more recently will be evaluated more advantageously. The design of all example projects must have been completed within the past four (4) years (prior to the SF-330 due date for this solicitation). The evaluation will consider the relevancy (design and construction scope, size and location) of projects identified. For the purposes of this evaluation the A-E may submit no more than two example projects which were investigations or studies only. The investigation(s) or study(ies) must have been completed within the past four (4) years (prior to the SF-330 due date for this solicitation) as well.

c) Examples of work submitted that do not meet the requirements specified here will not be evaluated. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified and eliminated from further consideration. Identify any key personnel in SF-330, Part I, Section G that worked on the projects and their role. Specialized experience and technical competency will be evaluated for ability to support the range of work required for this contract, as demonstrated by firm&rsquo;s submitted projects.



C. Capacity:

SF-330, Part I, Block H. Demonstrate how the firm(s) will manage, coordinate, and administer the work within the prime and among any teaming partners. Teaming partners to be included by the prime firm in their response should be clearly identified as such for evaluation purposes and will later be agreed to during negotiations of any resultant contract. SF-330, Part II, Block 11 will also be evaluated to assist in determining this factor. SF-330 Part I Blocks C, D, F and SF-330, Part II will also be evaluated to support this criterion. NCO 23 will consider any information which may be pertinent to this criterion, including the following:

&bull; Capacity to perform work in-house and with teaming members.

&bull; Demonstrate active on-going Federal and Non-Federal work (Address current dollar value of work, number of current projects, management approach to your on-going work, and how the team will support the work requirements outlined in this synopsis in addition to current work). Quantify the A-E teams reserve capacity (percent of available capacity or man hours available or number of man hours available).

&bull; Greater weight will be given to offerors who provide quantitative data to support an assertion of sufficient work-load capacity.





E. Past performance:

SF-330, Block H. For the example projects provided under Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, in a single page narrative form provide past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules for each example project submitted under Specialized Experience and Technical Competence. In addition to past performance information provided, the evaluation will include information available within the VA, Federal, state, private industry, or other sources. In addition to the narrative described above, forward the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) of this synopsis, to each project point of contact. Completed PPQ forms shall be submitted as part of the firms&rsquo; proposal package. Firms may include any ratings, letters of appreciation or performance, awards etc., for relevant experience; however, Federal database content and PPQs will be evaluated more advantageously. Reponses will be evaluated to determine firms&rsquo; ability to maintain cost, schedule, quality, and customer satisfaction.

If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) as long as it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis. Offerors should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government&#39;s point of contact, Network Contracting Office 23, Attn: Dwayne Brauch via email at dwayne.brauch@va.gov  prior to the response date.



F. Geographic Proximity:

Geographic proximity to the general area of the requiring activity as well as knowledge of Minneapolis VA Health Care Campus and surrounding Federal Properties. SF-330, Part I, Block H. In single page narrative form demonstrate firm&rsquo;s familiarity with local conditions to include knowledge of, and experience dealing with, the regulatory agencies, geological features, logistics, costs, climatic conditions and local design and construction methods. Narrative shall include team location, including main offices, branch offices, and any subconsultant offices.





G. Subcontracting Efforts:

Commitment to VHA shall be detailed in SF-330, Part I, Block H. Offerors shall identify and commit to the use of service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses, Veteran-owned small businesses, and other types of small businesses as subcontractors.

275d257c3da640c385cc3332be328dd8,FAA-25-001a,Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) Antenna System,"The Federal Aviation Administration intends to award a single source contract to dB Systems Inc. in Hurricane, UT.

The Federal Aviation Administration is proposing to acquire electronically scanned TACAN Antenna Systems, and capabilities related to implementation and installation support services for TACAN Antenna 900E Systems at multiple locations throughout the National Airspace System (NAS).  The acquisition will utilize single source procedures.  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System, AMS 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA&#39;s decision to contract with a selected source when it is determined to be in the best interest of the FAA. Legacy TACAN Antenna Systems (i.e., Low Power TACAN Antenna (LPTA), Rho Theta Antenna (RTA)-2) in the National Airspace System (NAS) are currently operating well beyond their intended service life, and, consequently, there are immediate operational shortfalls and unacceptable failure rates that must be addressed. The oldest TACAN Antennas were designed and manufactured in the 1950s and fielded starting in the 1960s. The FAA requires approximately 38 of the TACAN Antenna 900E in critical operational sites including support spare systems and installation services. The dB Systems 900E TACAN Antenna System was authorized by the FAA for nationwide use in the NAS (NAS Change Proposal (NCP) 38625; Case File JW143-TACAN-1009; National Stock Number (NSN) 0052-00-908-1002) on September 8, 2022. The 900E is the only TACAN Antenna System that has been approved for nationwide use that is still in production.  It is in the best interest of the FAA to award a contract to dB Systems Inc. on a single-source basis because the 900E TACAN Antenna Systems are independently designed, manufactured, and patented by dB Systems, and there are no authorized resellers. If this proposed action is not approved, availability of the TACAN service will continue to degrade, increasing the risk to safety and operational efficiency at the regional level. This would also delay the FAA from addressing critical operational needs that exist today in the NAS. TACAN Antenna outages pose significant safety risks for both civilian and military aircraft that use the TACAN Antenna service.

This announcement is for informational purposes only and not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal.  This requirement will be awarded to dB Systems Inc. and is not available for full and open competition. All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to Michael Jones, Contracting Officer, michael.e.jones01@faa.gov no later than 12 pm (ET) on June 24, 2025. 

Note: The FAR references cited in SAM.gov are not applicable to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as the FAA has its own policies and guidance referenced in the Acquisition Management System (AMS).

THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   



Brand Name: Tronair is the most recognized jack for the Gulfstream aircraft and is recommended by Gulfstream in the technical manuals. The one feature of the 30 ton jack we are requesting is the capability to use an air manifold kit that other jacks cannot provide. The manifold kit allows the mechanics to use shop air to raise both wing jacks simultaneously to keep the aircraft level versus individual jacks being hand pumped by personnel. Manifolding the jacks saves time and resources when raising the aircraft. Since the Tronair jack is the most common jack, servicing, maintenance, and parts are readily available and any GSE service company can work on them.

8c356e9f33a341aca92c78e7ab4389bf,89243323CFE000075,Synopsis of proposed increase of the Strategic Analysis Support Services Contract,"The U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory, located in Morgantown, WV; Pittsburgh, PA; and Albany, OR, intends to issue a single source modification to increase the ceiling on the Strategic Analysis (SA) Support Services Contract with KeyLogic, LLC (KeyLogic), a large business.

The SA Support Services Contract focuses on four major types of activities: (1) planning for the strategic direction of NETL and the programs implemented at NETL; (2) conducting comprehensive energy analysis across a range of scales from energy markets, resource availability and distribution, to technoeconomic and life cycle analysis of specific programs, technologies and systems; (3) the development and application of modeling and analysis tools and capabilities that address emerging challenges that cannot be adequately addressed with existing approaches; and (4) identification and cultivation of partners and sponsors/customers for NETL R&amp;D and analysis, enabling technology transfer and maturation, ultimately expanding and enhancing the national impact of NETL capabilities.

The proposed contract ceiling increase of $175M will allow SA support to continue at NETL uninterrupted. If the contract ceiling increase does not occur, the SA ceiling is insufficient to enable the Contractor to continue full operations for the base period of performance or full performance under the option period, if exercised, and could require NETL to suspend major mission support under the contract work activities until a new or substantially modified contract is put in place. KeyLogic is the only source capable of providing the unique mix of requisite services.

This synopsis is issued as required per FAR Part 5.2 on the proposed contract action and will be posted until July 7, 2025. You may contact Ms. Amanda Lopez, Contract Specialist, via email at Amanda.Lopez@netl.doe.gov with an email titled &ldquo;Interest in SA Synopsis&rdquo;.

This acquisition is expected to be conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-2 (Unusual and compelling urgency).



The U.S. Department of State intends to procure additional radar systems and accessories to support an International Narcotics and Law Enforcement program from Echodyne Corp, on a non-competitive basis. The Government intends to award a single award to streamline the acquisition process and acquire these items directly from the small business manufacturer. The contract will allow for support services, additional radars, and related accessories.



In 2024, INL procured approximately 40 Echodyne Corp radar systems at an overall cost of approximately $22 million for two countries, including training, spare parts, and logistics support for radar deployment. The radars are currently operational for INL programs and have proven to be successful. Reference delivery orders 19AQMM24F2077 and 19AQMM24F2112, which were awarded using competitive procedures via IDIQ number 19AQMM21D0042. 



A transition to a new radar system will cost the government millions of dollars in reinvestment of new equipment, training, and critical software upgrades.  INL expects it would require at least one (1) year to retrain partner nations&rsquo; personnel and procure additional equipment for a similar successful deployment.



A Justification and Approval will follow this notice.

a93bf0ba4dd94362b03673c3088276a6,80GSFC25R7015,Space weather Observations at L1 (SOL) Series X-ray Irradiance Sensor (XRIS),"Pre-Solicitation Notice for Space weather Observations at Lagrange 1 (SOL) X-ray Irradiance Sensor (XRIS)

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plan to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Space weather Observations at Lagrange 1 (SOL) X-Ray Irradiance Sensor (XRIS) instrument.

SOL is a high priority joint undertaking by NASA and NOAA. Two SOL Observatories will provide NOAA with the continuity of solar wind data, Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) imagery, and the second observatory will provide X-ray irradiance data from the XRIS instrument.

The X-ray Irradiance Sensor (XRIS) instrument will be used to measure the energy power from solar radiation per unit area to detect changes in solar activity, like solar flares, and help predict solar energetic particle events that can penetrate the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. The instrument will monitor X-ray flares that can cause changes in the Earth&rsquo;s ionosphere such as strong radio bursts that may interfere with radio frequencies and cause problems for satellite communication and navigation systems. Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are sometimes associated with solar flares which can lead to geomagnetic storms.

SOL will procure one (1) flight and one (1) spare XRIS instrument that will provide NOAA with the continuity and resilience of space weather observations for the X-ray irradiance. The X-ray irradiance measurement is a high availability (HAP) product, which is one of the National Weather Service&rsquo;s highest priorities for space weather observations. The continuation of these observations is essential for space weather predictions and the creation of actionable warnings for the protection of critical infrastructure that includes different sectors in the nation like aviation, commerce, energy, space exploration, and defense. XRIS will fly on the second observatory, SOL-B, which is targeted to launch in October 2032.

The contract scope includes those tasks necessary to design, analyze, develop, and fabricate one (1) flight and one (1) spare XRIS instrument. The Statement of Work defines the tasks necessary to integrate, test, calibrate, evaluate, support launch, perform on-orbit check-out of the X-Ray Irradiance Sensors, supply and maintain the instrument Ground Support Equipment (GSE), Ground Processing Algorithms, and support the Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) through mission hand over to NOAA.

The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

This procurement will be conducted as a full and open competition.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and Size Standard are 336414 and 1,330, respectively.

It is anticipated that this competitive procurement will result in a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) hardware contract with severable funding for two (2) X-Ray Irradiance Sensors: one (1) flight and one (1) spare.

The overall period of performance of the contract is anticipated to be from the date of contract award through January 2034 (fifteen (15) months after launch of the second mission, which is anticipated to be October 2032) for a total of approximately 8 years. The period of performance for the contract includes operational handover to NOAA of the final instrument. The handover to NOAA will happen after successful launch, post launch evaluation, calibration, data validation, and on-orbit anomaly investigations. The first flight model shall be delivered by June 2029 and the second by December 2029.

The Draft RFP will be posted for information and planning purposes. No proposal is requested, and no contract will be awarded as a result of the Draft RFP. Potential Offerors are invited to comment on all aspects of the solicitation including the requirements, proposal instructions, and evaluation approach. If your comments include recommendations for revisions, you must provide your rationale for such revisions. The timeline for comments to the Draft RFP will be specified in the Draft RFP Cover Letter.

This synopsis shall serve as the pre-solicitation notice for the Draft RFP.

88c64684989f43a9a1f03823231c4651,20150753,Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC),"On November 16, 2022, US CBP issued a Notice of Opportunity inviting the Department of Energy Qualified ESCOs to submit proposals in accordance with the GSA SIN 334512 ESPC ENABLE-Hybrid Approach for the US CBP sites throughout the United States.

The purpose of the procurement was to use an ENABLE ESPC to complete energy conservation and resiliency measures to upgrade and install the most cost-effective systems and processes to improve energy efficiency, operational performance, and continuity of operations of CBP&rsquo;s facility portfolio. The proposals focused on upgrading/installing equipment related to improving the efficiency and update the performance of outdated energy, water, electrical, plumbing and building envelope equipment. The ESPC will not use any appropriated funding. The project will be financed and energy savings guaranteed by the Energy Services Company (ESCO). Annual payments of principal and interest are made from the utility budget.

A competitive process was completed per FAR Part 8-405. The ESCO proposals were evaluated and based on the competitive process, US CBP selected The Brewer Garrett Company in April, 2023 as the best qualified ESCO to complete an energy savings performance contract (ESPC) for the US CBP facilities.
The Brewer Garrett Company was issued a Notice of Intent to Award for the Investment Grade Audit on April 12, 2023. Since then, The Brewer Garrett Company has completed site visits, meetings with US CBP facilities staff, utility analysis, and spent significant time and expertise developing the energy conservation measures that will be implemented to accomplish the efficiency and resiliency objectives of the ESPC.

Since April 2023, The Brewer Garrett Company has engaged with US CBP to perform numerous site visits and an Investment Grade Audit (IGA) for the ESPC project which focuses on reducing energy consumption, increasing energy resiliency and reliability and addressing operations and maintenance. The implementation of the proposed measures will improve efficiency and update performance of outdated energy, water, electrical, plumbing and building envelope equipment. Funding for this energy and resiliency project is derived not from new capital appropriations, but from current utility and operational dollars saved by the efficiency and operational improvements. The savings will be guaranteed by The Brewer Garrett Company. This project benefits the U.S. Government in multiple strategic and financial ways, aligning with broader national goals of fiscal responsibility, operational resiliency and efficiency and public service. The guaranteed savings will fund the much-needed HVAC improvements and energy/operational resiliency. This ESPC delivers essential upgrades to US CBP, funded entirely through guaranteed energy savings without additional taxpayer funding. These upgrades ensure long-term operational stability, system resiliency, minimizing emergency repairs and maximizing resources.

The original contract vehicle for the ESPC award is no longer available as the ENABLE ESPC was eliminated from Multiple Award Schedule &ldquo;Total Solution Support Products for Facilities Management Systems (SIN 334512) on April 1, 2025. Conducting a new procurement would be cost prohibitive since US CBP would lose all the work completed over the past two years including market research, analysis of the marketplace/ESCOs, procurement activities, evaluation of proposals, and the significant amount of work already completed by The Brewer Garrett Company.

852.219-73 VA NOTICE TO TOTAL SET-ASIDE FOR VERIFIED SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES (NOV 2022) 

(a) Definition. for the Department of Veterans Affairs,  Service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern or SDVOSB :

(1) Means a small business concern -

(i) Not less than 51 percent of which is owned by one or more service-disabled Veterans or, in the case of any publicly owned business, not less than 51 percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more service-disabled Veterans or eligible surviving spouses (see VAAR802.101, Surviving Spouse definition);

(ii) The management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more service-disabled Veterans (or eligible surviving spouses) or, in the case of a service-disabled Veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such Veteran;

(iii) The business meets Federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code identified in the solicitation document;

(iv) The business has been verified for ownership and control pursuant to 38 CFR part 74 and is listed in VA's Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database at https://www.vetbiz.va.gov/vip/; and

(v) The business will comply with VAAR subpart 819.70 and Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations regarding small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR parts 121 and 125, provided that any reference therein to a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern or SDVO SBC, is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB, unless otherwise stated in this clause.

(2) The term  Service-disabled Veteran  means a Veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16).

(3) The term  small business concern  has the meaning given that term under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

(4) The term  small business concern owned and controlled by Veterans with service-connected disabilities  has the meaning given the term  small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans  under section 3(q)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q)(2)), except that for a VA contract the firm must be listed in the VIP database (see paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this clause).

(b) General.
(1) Offers are solicited only from VIP-listed SDVOSBs. Offers received from entities that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs at the time of offer shall not be considered.

(2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a VIP-listed SDVOSB who is eligible at the time of submission of offer(s) and at the time of award.

(3) The requirements in this clause apply to any contract, order or subcontract where the firm receives a benefit or preference from its designation as an SDVOSB, including set-asides, sole source awards, and evaluation preferences.

(c) Representation. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible to receive award of a resulting contract. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpart 819.70.

(d) Agreement. When awarded a contract action, including orders under multiple-award contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. Unless otherwise stated in this clause, a requirement in 13 CFR parts 121 and 125 that applies to an SDVO SBC, is to be construed to also apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or  similarly situated  (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219-75 or 852.219-76 as applicable). These requirements are summarized as follows:

(1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract.

(2) Supplies/products.
(i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. When a contract includes both supply and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract.

(ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a non-manufacturer, the SDVOSB prime contractor will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) has been granted. Refer to 13 CRF 125.6(a)(2)(ii) for guidance pertaining to multiple item procurements.

(3) General construction. In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.

(4) Special trade construction contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, may be paid to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.

(5) Subcontracting. An SDVOSB must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be listed in VIP to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6.

(e) Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period. An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows:

_X_By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or

__By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract.

(f) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any requirement therein that applies to an SDVO SBC is to be construed to apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants.

(g) Precedence. The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpart 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Program for SDVO SBCs, and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program.

(h) Misrepresentation. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company's SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406-2 Causes for Debarment).

(d) Agreement. When awarded a contract action, including orders under multiple-award contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. Unless otherwise stated in this clause, a requirement in 13 CFR parts 121 and 125 that applies to an SDVO SBC, is to be construed to also apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or  similarly situated  (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219-75 or 852.219-76 as applicable). These requirements are summarized as follows:

(1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract

(2) Supplies/products.
(i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. When a contract includes both supply and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract.

(ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a non-manufacturer, the SDVOSB prime contractor will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) has been granted. Refer to 13 CRF 125.6(a)(2)(ii) for guidance pertaining to multiple item procurements.

(3) General construction. In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.

(5) Subcontracting. An SDVOSB must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be listed in VIP to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6.

(e) Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period. An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows:

_X_By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or

(f) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any requirement therein that applies to an SDVO SBC is to be construed to apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants.

(g) Precedence. The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpart 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Program for SDVO SBCs, and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program.

(h) Misrepresentation. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company's SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406-2 Causes for Debarment).

1. This amendment reiterates that NAICS code associated with this solicitation is 336412, Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing.

2. This amendment also updates Section J, Attachment 2 IDIQ Pricing for Base Year and Options. Pricing for CLIN 004 is updated for offerors to provide pricing for the Engine Conversion: T700-GE-701C to 701D (FFP) only. 

3. This amendment also clarifies that Purchase of Engine (CLINs 011, 26, 41 and 56) is for a Factory New Engine.

4. This amendment also requires offerors to provide supporting rational on how their proposed technical approach will comply with FAR 52.219-4 Limitations on Subcontracting.

The FAA intends to extend Phase 3 of GEO 7 Task Order 2, which consists of GEO satellite and Ground Uplink Station (GUS) lease services, by up to 5 additional years. This extension will utilize single source procedures.

In accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Procurement Guidance T3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA&#39;s decision to contract with a single source when it is determined to be in the best interest of the FAA. Leidos, Inc. is the only source capable of meeting the FAA&#39;s requirement of extending the GEO 7 satellite and GUS leases as they are the current provider of the GEO 7 satellite and GUS leases under Task Order 2 and there are no other satellite payloads on orbit which can support the WAAS requirements of maintaining a three GEO constellation. Additionally, Leidos has an existing GUS site design, processes, and tools approved to meet WAAS requirements under this current task order.

This announcement is for informational purposes only and is not a Solicitation/Screening for Information Request/Request for Proposal. This extension will be awarded to Leidos, Inc. and is not available for full and open competition.

Note: FAR references cited in SAM.gov are not applicable to the FAA as the FAA has its own policies and guidance referenced in the FAA AMS.

10d7916162c84d529a74dcbfbe4f6bb5,6973GH-25-J-1200,PVP Camera IR 60-1200mm HD,"Title of Procurement
CBP - PVP Camera IR 60-1200mm HD

Nature of Procurement Action
Modification of existing contract 6973GH-24-D-00072 to add a direct replacement, IR 60-1200mm HD
camera. Lightweight 200-1200 HD IR is obsolete but will still have limited repair. If the camera needs
a Circuit Card Assembly (CCA), it will become beyond economical Repair (BER). Customs Border
Protection (CBP) will continue to use the Lightweight 200-1200 HD IR Camera until it is BER.
This is to continue an existing requirement for persistent surveillance technology along the Southern
Border of the United States. The Cameras are Utilized specifically by the Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT)
program for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).


The IR camera is a single piece of an integrated sensor suite consisting of IR and day cameras, laser
illuminators, pan tilt units and ground radar panels. All of these components must be controlled via a
single user interface provided by the command and control software. To introduce a piece of
technology made by a different manufacturer would take thousands of labor hours to test and
validate. The purchase and repair of the current IR camera is already included within the existing
IDIQ 6973GH-24-D-00072, however that camera originally included is not out of production and repair
components to keep them in operation are no longer available. PVP Aero the OEM created the IR 60-
1200mm HD camera to be a direct form, fit, function replacement for the obsolete lightweight 1200
HD IR. Due to the complexity and expense of integrating mixed hardware and the urgent demand for
surveillance technology on the border it is recommended that this effort is awarded under Single
Source Procedures to the existing IDIQ.

Description of Supplies/Services
The Federal Aviation Administration Logistics Center (FAALC) proposes to acquire, under single source
procedures, the inclusion of the IR 60-1200mm HD camera to replace existing fielded cameras some
of which have failed and cannot be repaired. Also repair services for these cameras and spare inventory
to be maintained by the government.

Authority
Authority for single source procurement is provided by AMS policy section 3.2.2.4.
An Inter-Agency Agreement between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal
Aviation Administration Logistics Center (FAALC) authorizes and funds the FAALC to provide the DHS
Customs &amp; Border Protection Agency (CBP) with supply chain management support, including the
award and administration of supplier contracts, as required for U.S. Border Security Systems and
necessary to accomplish the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency&rsquo;s mission.

Rationale Supporting Use of a Single Source
This award is being processed under Single Source Procedures, based upon the vendor&rsquo;s experience,
knowledge and expertise on the IFT system and equipment. The current request is also urgent in that
some cameras have failed and can no longer be repaired. The government has exhausted all the
remaining spares available, and this number was insufficient to keep up with the camera failures due
to the age of the equipment. Without immediate replacements the current loss of surveillance and
detection capabilities will continue. This allows for undetected threats to enter the United States.
Further detail is described below.


PVP&rsquo;s Knowledge and Expertise
The IFT program is used to protect our nation&rsquo;s borders from illegal aliens, weapons, and drug
trafficking under our Department of Homeland Security.
PVP Aero is the Original Equipment Manufacturer that can provide hardware that will seamlessly
integrate within their proprietary control system Due to the uniqueness of the system, especially the
sensor suite, PVP&rsquo;s knowledge and expertise is the only known source that will satisfy the needs of the
Government.


Urgent Time Frame
The &ldquo;like&rdquo; camera on the current contract is obsolete and can no longer be repaired if it requires a
circuit card. All spares inventory has been exhausted. The spares the government had available was
insufficient to bring all IFT sites back online. We currently have two sites offline and expect this trend
to continue as cameras reach the end of their lifecycle. With a gap in surveillance coverage, illegal
crossings will continue to go undetected. There have been many recent articles stating the increase
of illegal activity, including potential terrorism threats to the United States.


Border Surveillance is essential to carry out the CBP&rsquo;s mission statement, including the prevention of
illegal entry of people (Human Trafficking), drugs (specifically Fentanyl seizures) and weapons

36f5658eca684407b37c7ba8f78fc175,75H70125R00044,Facility Budget Estimating System (FBES) Construction Cost Data Special Location Factors Requirements Contract,"The Contractor shall establish accurate Construction Cost Data Special Location Factors for use in the Indian Health Service&rsquo;s (IHS) Facility Budget Estimating System (FBES). These Location Factors are located within the Lower 48 States and Alaska.

Special Location Factors are used within the FBES to account for the variation in construction costs in different geographic locations. Each geographic location where IHS facilities are located and constructed has its own location factor and represents a deviation from a national average. When estimating the construction cost for a specific project in a specific location, the FBES adjusts the base unit construction costs (the cost per square foot to construct various kinds of IHS facilities) by multiplying them by the location factor wherein the project is located.

The primary source of Standard Location Factors is the Marshall &amp; Swift Valuation Service (MVS) Section 99, Local Multipliers Data. The MV factors for Class A construction are used for this purpose. The Contractor will need to obtain a subscription to the MVS reference books in order to complete the work.

Contractor shall conduct the necessary market research for development of the Special Location Factors Report for the Lower 48 and Alaska areas for the base year (FY26) and for each option year (FY27 - FY30). Unless prior approval is obtained, travel will not be expected nor required.

This acquisition is being solicited as Unrestricted. All firms that perform work under NAICS 541330, Engineering Services, may submit proposals under this solicitation, regardless of business size, as long as that firm has also registered in SAM.gov. The size standard for NAICS 541330 is $25.5M.

This synopsis/solicitation is for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements type service contract that includes a base year and four option years. A Task order will be issued at the start of each option year to fund the yearly requirement and performance will proceed for that option year.

CASS is the exclusive system used to manage and verify authorized cockpit riders, ensuring that only those with proper clearance&mdash;such as flight crew, NTSB investigators, and safety study personnel&mdash;are granted access. This centralized system is critical for maintaining security and compliance, and any changes or enhancements to the system, such as providing the NTSB with direct, 24/7 access, would significantly improve the agency&#39;s ability to manage and control jumpseat access in real time.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.

33bd1e38c42341b794bdd6ddb73d08fc,80GSFC25R7024,NASA Search and Rescue System Support Contract,"National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Code 176.1, Office for Program Support, intends to negotiate solely with Techno-Sciences, Inc. (TSi), located in Lanham, MD for services and products related to the research, development, procurement, integration, delivery, testing, operations, maintenance, sustainment, upgrade, and replacement of search and rescue (SAR) systems, hardware, software, and technologies for NASA Local User Terminal (LUT) (Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Low Earth Orbit/Medium Earth Orbit (LEO/MEO), and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and SAR Mission Control Center (MCC)) operations. This action is in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, &ldquo;Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements&rdquo;. 

NASA GSFC requires improvements to beacon location processing, implementation of two-way communications with beacons, improvements to satellite scheduling and coordination, improvements in system reliability, availability and resiliency, improvements in beacon data analysis, distribution, and interface control; automated ground system performance monitoring, automated satellite performance monitoring; customization of LEO/MEO/GEO LUT and MCC functions and interfaces to meet the requirements of NASA and Human Space Flight (HSF) support.

It is critical the contractor delivering the hardware and software support required has a full understanding of existing SAR systems, hardware, software, and technologies for NASA LEO/MEO/GEO LUT and SAR MCC operations. This includes the integrated TSi-proprietary software used for beacon geo-locating/reporting representative of operational Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) Medium Earth Orbit Local User Terminals (MEOLUTs) and Geostationary Orbit Local User Terminals (GEOLUTs). This proprietary software package is required for elements of operational SARSAT support during SARSAT system-wide anomaly resolution, as well as serving as the software backbone behind future GEOLUT and MEOLUT-specific R&amp;D tasks, due to the shared software configurations with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United States Coast Guard (USCG), and United States Air Force (USAF) partner facilities supporting real-world SAR operations. TSi possesses unique knowledge and expertise as the proprietary vendor responsible for the original and current installation of GSFC SARLab MEOLUT hardware and software, as well as continual maintenance of proprietary and company-specific GEOLUT and MEOLUT infrastructure. 

The Government intends to issue a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with an effective ordering period of 5 years. The Government also intends to include FAR Clause 52.217-8, Options to Extend Services, within the contract.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334511; Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing; Business Size: 1,350 Employees.

9243cd0525274c69b21a915ab5e0a459,SNFD-2025-362,Eighteen (18) subdermal implantable telemetry tags,"NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SINGLE-SOURCE CONTRACTSpecial Notice: SNFD-2025-362

NOAA/NMFS/SEFSC

In compliance with FAR Subpart 13 coupled with the provisions set forth by FAR Subpart 5.101(a)(1), this Notice is hereby published to inform of the following:

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Wildlife Computers Inc.

Using the procedures of FAR Part 13 the requirement is to procure the following: Eighteen (18) SPLASH10-373A Implantable Tags

The applicable Size Standard is North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334511 with a Small business size standard of 1350 employees.

This Sole Source Determination is based on NOAAA&#39;s requirement that is the only Vendor that provides the required Supplies:The NOAA NMFS and partner institutions use implantable telemetry tags to study the movements, habitats, and foraging behavior of large whales, including endangered sperm whales in the Gulf of America. These implantable tags are deployed remotely and are embedded in the blubber of the animal using an anchoring system that allows the tag to remain attached for weeks to months before falling off. Data on movements and dive behavior are transmitted continuously throughout the deployment via satellite (ARGOS) communication. This requires a specially designed sensor, power, and transmission package. The attachment anchor and electronic portion of the tag are consolidated into a single body which both increases the longevity of attachment and reduces the potential for injury to the animal. Tags of this type have been used by NOAA and partner agencies to study large whale movements world wide. The requestd tags will be used for a field research project in the summer of 2025.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: The SEFSC requires eighteen (18) subdermal implantable telemetry tags with the following capabilities:
Consolidated design electronics and anchoring unit designed and tested for subdermal deployment on large whales including sperm whales
Sufficient battery duration to support data collection and transmission for at least 6 months
Ability to continuously transmit collected data during deployment via the ARGOS Iridium satellite system
Capability to collect and transmit data on location (via ARGOS satellite localization), animal depth, tag wet/dry status, summaries of dive depth, and information on dive depth, type and duration
Operating water depths up to 2000m
Ability to program duty cycles and transmission cycles to optimize battery life and data transmission frequency
Designed for remote deployment via airgun or other handheld system to allow deployment from small boats

The units must be consistent with telemetry tags deployed by SEFSC and other NMFS line offices to ensure data comparability. The anchoring system and tag body must have demonstrated effectiveness and safe deployment on large whales to meet the requirements of SEFSC&rsquo;s Marine Mammal Protection Act research permit.

These tags are needed in hand no later than July 1, 2025 for the Sperm Whale Population Consequences of Multiple Stressors (PCOMS) project (GU-25-03).

These are highly specialized equipment. The design of these tags is the result of multiple years of research (including in collaboration with NOAA scientists) to improve retention times (i.e., increase and improve data collection) and reduce the risk of harm to the whale (i.e., preventing injuries to whales that violate the terms of our MMPA research permits and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval). Wildlife Computers is the only vendor available for this highly specialized equipment.

706335a90e99471386dd52caf9c22f1e,140G0325Q0119,19--FLOATING BARGE WITH FIN ANTENNA,"Synopsis:The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Colombia River Research Laboratory requires floating PIT-tag detection arrays with transceivers that can detect 134.2 kHz Full- and Half-duplex PIT tags and can power multiple antennas. Two floating arrays are desired downstream of Foster Dam to provide route specific data for juvenile salmonid passage. Best design for these two arrays is a barge with fin antennas. Fin antennas are oriented vertically in the water column and can pivot upward to shed debris or for maintenance. Fins should be capable of being raised and lowered remotely. The barge itself should be a platform for housing transceiver controls and power. One floating array is desired downstream of Green Peter Dam. Due to the shallow nature of the river, a fin system is not practical, but a floating matrix antenna array can operate at the range of water depths at this site due to rapid changes in dam discharge. Transceiver control and power system will be shore mounted for the matrix antenna and the transceiver control and wiring should allow for possible expansion to additional matrix or bottom mounted antennas. The arrays we require at both sites need to be designed and equipped to deploy from a cross-channel skyline with ability to move laterally for maintenance or prevention of flood damage.The USGS is contemplating a single, firm-fixed price order in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13.5, entitled, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.

	INTRODUCTION


The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) mission is to safeguard our nation by anticipating and confronting security threats through our aviation and maritime law enforcement expertise, innovative capabilities, and partnerships at the border and beyond. AMO achieves its mission by monitoring thousands of miles of air, maritime, and land borders around the clock; defending the United States against terrorist threats; detecting and deterring illicit trafficking in persons, drugs, weapons, money, and other goods; and disrupting criminal networks.

AMO is one of the lead federal organizations in aviation and maritime law enforcement, and participates in joint operations with U.S. Border Patrol (USBP), Office of Field Operations (OFO), other DHS components, and other law enforcement agencies. AMO seeks to predict, detect, identify, classify, track, deter, and interdict threats to the continuity of border security of the United States and to safeguard our homeland through the coordinated application of aviation and maritime law enforcement resources within the air, sea, and land. This includes detecting and deterring illicit border crossings; interdicting targets; conducting investigative activities; collecting intelligence; performing patrols and surveillance; and preventing the import/export of illegal merchandise and contraband.

AMO applies advanced aeronautical and maritime capabilities and employs its unique skill sets to support the overarching Department of Homeland Security (DHS) strategic goal of preserving America&#39;s security interests. As part of the larger CBP fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft fleet, CBP operates the General Atomics &ndash; Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) MQ-9 Predator B/Guardian Unmanned Aircraft System. GA-ASI is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the MQ-9. Alongside the existing fleet of MQ-9 UAS, the Government intends to operate and sustain future variants of the MQ-9. The MQ-9 UAS directly supports the specific strategic goals and missions from the DHS Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, as well as AMO&rsquo;s Vision and Strategy 2030.

CBP UAS support a broad range of DHS mission scenarios and environments along and across terrestrial and maritime environments on the borders of the United States, using a variety of sensors. The CBP UAS currently augments crewed air and ground interdiction agents deployed on the Southwest and Northern Border and complements crewed air and maritime assets and ground interdiction agents on the Northern Border and in the Southeast Border Region.  Expeditionary deployments outside these areas may be required to support other DHS missions, to include operations outside of the United States. CBP UAS currently operate from the National Air Security Operations Centers (NASOCs) and/or at Forward Operating Locations (FOLs).

2.  REQUEST

CBP is seeking to identify potential Vendor sources for MQ-9 Predator B/Guardian UAS operational and maintenance support services. As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs. Although &ldquo;proposal&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; are used in this Request for Information, Vendor responses will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.

This initiative is being spearheaded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) within the PEO Electronic Systems Directorate's International C2 & Sensors Division. The overarching goal of this effort is to enhance defense capabilities against air and tactical ballistic missile threats, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By improving situational awareness, airspace management, and operational force protection, the USAF aims to bolster the defense of high-value assets through a modernized Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) system.

The type of work requested involves developing a system that supports a wide array of sensors, weapons, and Command, Control, Communications, Compute, Cyber, and Intelligence (C5I) infrastructure. This system should facilitate battle management and defensive counter-air operations while also supporting active/passive air defense measures and cyber defense logistics. A key requirement for this project is scalability; the system must be capable of modular growth across all areas of C5I to accommodate evolving sensor technologies and weaponry advancements.

In line with Executive Order 14271 on ensuring commercial cost-effective solutions in federal contracts, this modernization effort emphasizes integrating Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products and Non-Developmental Items (NDIs). The program seeks to achieve seamless interoperability between U.S. systems and those of partner nations while ensuring uninterrupted air defense operations during the transition phase. Vendors are encouraged to showcase their expertise in leveraging existing legacy systems to deploy advanced air surveillance capabilities without compromising mission continuity.",Federal Acquisition Service,2025-05-15 00:00:00+00:00,2025-05-15,2025-05-29 17:00:00+00:00,2025-05-29,,Sources Sought,,541330,Engineering Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEDERAL ACQUISITION SERVICE,,Boston,MA,02222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8c8612b45a1b57cb81d023028706d852-re,,,,,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/r-RFQ1758056-re,https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/seller/prepare-quote/RFQ1758056?contractNumber=

The majority of work is anticipated to be completed by structural and civil engineers to address earthquake engineering evaluations and design, and flood inundation evaluation and adaptative design, respectively, but studies, assessments, evaluations, and designs for other natural hazards may be required. Furthermore, assessment and design scopes may include related considerations and require services of other disciplines given the integrated nature of building performance (e.g., seismic retrofits or flood adaptation may necessitate architectural, mechanical, and/or electrical evaluation/design services), so the offerors&rsquo; teams shall have access to a multi-disciplinary team to cover all necessary design disciplines for comprehensive assessments and design solutions.



Task orders may require, but not be limited to developing natural hazard design parameters and exposure maps (e.g., limited seismicity updates, flood modeling and map development, wind speed studies) either at the regional/city and/or site-specific scale; conducting building and/or site vulnerability assessments (e.g. rapid visual screening of buildings for potential seismic hazards, flood vulnerability assessments, wind vulnerability assessments) across the global diplomatic portfolio; whole mission resilience adaptation assessments; and detailed building or site-specific analyses and design development.  Other tasks may include research/literature reviews; assisting in evolving the way OBO conducts global portfolio natural hazard risk assessments; development of toolsets; enhancing emergency preparedness and rapid mobilizations providing engineering support to missions in areas having experienced a natural disaster; assistance in developing or updating GIS-based global natural hazard exposure data; and/or general advisement on matters related to OBO&rsquo;s mission of managing overseas diplomatic platforms and managing its natural hazard risks. The work may require travel to overseas U.S. diplomatic missions.



All proposals will be categorized into one of two specialties based on the focus area selected by the Offeror and should be consistent with the prime contractor&rsquo;s area of expertise: Earthquake Engineering (structural engineering team prime), or Flood Evaluation and Adaptive Design (civil engineering team prime specializing in flood evaluation and adaptive design). Offerors must clearly indicate in the proposal the specialty being proposed.  Offerors are allowed to participate in both specialties either as a prime contractor and/or as part of other prime Offeror&rsquo;s team; however, can be the prime Offeror on only one proposal submitted for each specialty. 



Though the Government intends to make awards in this way, all proposals will be evaluated against all evaluation factors, and the Offerors are expected to be capable of executing task orders for all work identified in the Solicitation. Accordingly, all offerors&rsquo; proposals are expected to have multi-disciplinary team of in-house and/or sub-consultants (project management, architecture, geotechnical, mechanical, electrical, adaptation professionals, and cost estimating) with an appropriate hierarchical composition (principles, senior engineers, junior engineers, clerical, drafters, etc.) having demonstrated experience and competency of completing comprehensive multi-hazard assessments inclusive of studies, assessments, evaluations, and designs for other natural hazards.



Under each of these IDIQ contracts, the Government guarantees a minimum of $6,000 for the life of the contract. Separate task orders will be competed under these contracts, as necessary, during the execution of the contract to authorize services.  Each contract will be for a one-year period from the date of contract award with four one-year option periods. Contract duration shall not exceed five years.  The maximum task orders awarded over the length of each contract shall not exceed $12.5 million.



Selection procedures and awards will be made in accordance with FAR Part 36 for Architectural and Engineering services.



The Phase 1 Pre-Qualification announcement is currently planned to be posted on SAM.gov in or around June 2025.




	Eligibility to Perform Under Contract:

	
		Successful offerors must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DOD) Secret or Top-Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding authorization, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M.  Personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at DoS sites must possess Secret or Top-Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance. 
		FCL Sponsorship will be given if needed (see below Section B). Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. 
		Subcontractors who will require access to classified information or CAA spaces must also possess a Secret or Top Secret FCL and personnel clearances prior to performance.
		The intention is to award at least one contract to a firm already possessing a Top-Secret FCL, and at least one contract to a firm already possessing a Secret FCL; therefore, favorable consideration will be given to firms with an existing Top Secret FCL and existing Secret FCL. 
		Firms who possess Secret FCLs may be sponsored for an upgrade to Top-Secret after contract award.
		Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
	
	
	If a selected offeror does not already possess an Interim or Final Secret FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for a Secret FCL. 
	
		DoS will also sponsor joint ventures for an FCL; however, each entity comprising a joint venture must possess or be able to obtain an FCL prior to issuance of an FCL to the joint venture.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. 
		A period of six calendar months from award of the contract will be allowed for this offeror to obtain the necessary FCL. After this period the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding a contract to another firm.   
		Contracts cannot be awarded until selected firms receive an FCL.

The data and analysis will be used to model the cell-to-pack and cell-to-system costs for NMC811-Graphite and LFP-Graphite batteries in a plant, with a capacity of 25,000 vehicles per year. Designs and estimates will be provided for three separate battery systems with required energies of 100, 200, and 500 kWh. This corresponds to six total designs and estimates - i.e., two chemistries for all three kWh requirements. This work is expected to provide Argonne with the design of cells, modules, and packs that are assembled in lithium-ion battery systems for medium- and heavy-duty (MHD) vehicles and the resulting cell-to-pack and pack-to-system cost. The battery systems are designed for vehicles in the USA and are manufactured in the USA.

The PHOMI is planned to fly on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) SWGEO program satellites. NASA seeks information on instrument concepts for photospheric magnetograph imagers capable of producing Line of Sight (LOS) measurements of the photospheric magnetic field. High resolution mapping of the solar photospheric magnetic field is a critical input to model the solar wind velocity, density, and magnetic polarity. In addition to magnetic field measurement, doppler velocity observations are also of interest. While only LOS observations are required, if capabilities could be extended to vector measurements, the Government would be looking to understand and have potential offerors describe any impacts on the sensor Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP), cost, and risk.

If awarded, the Government anticipates awarding up to four Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contracts, each valued at approximately $1.5 million with a potential 12 month period of performance (one nine-month Base Period and one three-month Option Period).

The Government anticipates releasing a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) during May 2025. This will be an opportunity for potential offerors to provide questions, comments, or concerns regarding the DRFP. The Government will not accept any proposals or offers for the DRFP.

The Government anticipates releasing a Final Request for Proposal (RFP) during June 2025 with an anticipated offer due date 30 days after release.

The Government does not intend to award a resultant contract using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services).

This procurement will be a Full and Open Competition with no anticipated Small Business goals for this procurement.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 with a Size Standard of $25.5 million.

All responsible sources may submit an offer when applicable, which shall be considered by NASA GSFC. NASA FAR (NFS) clause 1852.215-84 (Ombudsman) is applicable. The GSFC Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.nasa.gov/ombuds-office/ombuds-contact-us/.

The Government intends to utilize the authority under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106(b)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements, unless, as a result of this announcement, acceptable responses to this notice are received and a determination is made by the Government to issue a competitive solicitation.  The Government intends to award a purchase order to FP2 Fire Protection, Inc.

Sole Source Justification:

FP2 Fire Protection has a licensed Fire Protection Engineer on staff who has served as a Fire Marshall and is also a member of several NFPA committees tasked with rewriting the Codes including NFPA 2 - Hydrogen. The FP2 Fire Protection Engineer using his knowledge of the NWS balloon launching process and safety procedures was able to have NFPA accept the use of hydrogen as a balloon lifting gas.

The FP2 Fire Protection Engineer has performed Alternate Means and Methods (AMM) Analyses for NWS for the Anchorage, Barrow and Fairbanks AK, Midland-Odessa TX, Greensboro NC, Charleston SC, Norman OK, North Platte NE, Salt Lake City UT, and Spokane WA WFOs. This engineer has created plans for the conversion from helium to hydrogen at the NWS Gray ME WFO and the DOE Great Plains Climate Research Facility.

In addition, FP2 Fire Protection has created the Hydrogen Inflation Safety System [HISS] which is used in a number of the NWS WFOs. The HISS will be an integral part of the Key West conversion plan and the Topeka KS Replacement WFO

If another Fire Protection firm is used, they will require several years to reach the level of expertise that FP2 Fire Protection has. This will result in an increase in the planning phase time and thus increase the costs by $22,000.  If the project is not done right, there is a chance of facility damange due to not being converted correctly.

0888d09263854eca95a2d2af426bbdba,NASA-GSFC-LISA-ETU-Telescope,Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Engineering Test Unit (ETU) Telescope,"NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center has a requirement for the design, development, fabrication, alignment, testing, verification, delivery, and associated post-delivery support services for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Engineering Test Unit (ETU) telescope. As part of its contribution to the European Space Agency (ESA)-led mission, NASA GSFC will deliver the LISA ETU telescope to ESA, which is required to efficiently transfer laser power between optical benches across 2.5 million kilometers in order to transfer enough laser light between spacecraft.  

NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center intends to issue a sole source contract to acquire the items and services from L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (L3Harris) under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, &ldquo;Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&rdquo;

L3Harris involvement with LISA began with the LISA Study Office design study in 2018, which was issued to multiple industry partners through a task under NASA&rsquo;s Mechanical Integration Services and Technologies (MIST) contract. The purpose of the study was to examine the Government&rsquo;s strawman optical and mechanical design and requirements, assess how it could be built, supply a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate, and a list of risks for building the Structural Thermal Model (STM) and the Engineering Development Unit (EDU) telescopes. The information gained from the study led to a competitive procurement to produce the STM and the EDU telescopes for LISA. L3Harris was awarded NASA GSFC contract 80GSFC20C0056 in 2020 for the development of the LISA STM and EDU telescopes. L3Harris&rsquo; first telescope in the EDU telescope development program was the STM. It successfully demonstrated the telescope build process and verified that the design and material met the very demanding LISA stability requirements. The second telescope, known as EDU1, was built to meet all LISA requirements, and demonstrated excellent optical performance. L3Harris successfully demonstrated that an all-glass telescope that met the extremely demanding LISA performance requirements could be built.

Leveraging the existing procedures, equipment, and facilities at L3Harris will enable the Government to design, test, build, and deliver the LISA ETU telescope to ESA on schedule and within the budget constraints that would otherwise be impossible if another vendor was selected either to continue the current design and/or start from scratch with the LISA telescope requirements. A duplication of the resources already spent by NASA dating back to 2018 would cost millions of dollars and take at least another three (3) years to bring another industry partner to the stage of design/development that L3Harris is currently at with the LISA telescope.

To meet the LISA ETU telescope delivery date to ESA, NASA GSFC must continue the development and production of the LISA ETU telescope as soon as possible in order to receive the LISA ETU telescope no later than March 2028.. Failure to deliver the ETU telescope in the required timeframe will result in significant cost impacts that cannot be absorbed by the LISA project. It will additionally result in unacceptable schedule impacts that would be magnified in the flight production phase and ultimately could result in the cancellation of the mission.

The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial product or commercial service using FAR Part 12.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort electronically via email to Contracting Officer Stefan Flessa at stefan.d.flessa@nasa.gov no later than 5:00PM EDT on May 21, 2025. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this acquisition on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

5f04e885a7754f9f937926faa44d0bd9,80LARC25RFI_AFP_AIS_2,Automated Inspection Systems,"Under the Hi-rate Composites for Aircraft Manufacturing (HiCAM) Project, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) /Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information from potential commercial sources for an automated inspection system (AIS) capable of ply-by-ply inspection of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) during the automated fiber placement (AFP) aerospace composite manufacturing process. AFP has traditionally been used for building large acreage structures like wing skins, spars, and fuselages. Through the years, the AFP equipment has improved significantly in terms of meeting high material placement rates, but inspection processes have lagged behind. Some of it is due to the lack of advanced technology in this area while some of it is due to AFP users having different inspection requirements that equipment suppliers have to meet. As a result, significant time is spent on manual/visual inspection of very large parts that significantly slows down the overall rate of the composites aircraft primary structure manufacturing process. In addition, the lack of recorded data limits understanding and improving for the process. The primary goal of the HiCAM project is to demonstrate manufacturing approaches and associated technologies for large composite airframe structures that enable high-rate production (up to 80 aircraft per month) with reduced cost and no weight penalty versus 2020 technologies. The Project will develop and mature affordable high-rate composite manufacturing and assembly technologies, with reduced equipment and tooling costs, enabling a faster, more cost-effective production cycle for lightweight airframe structures. In this regard, NASA has partnered with the United States Aircraft manufacturing industry to define and standardize the inspection requirements for AFP with the goal of identifying a commercially available, or commercially developed, AIS system capable of meeting  the standardized inspection requirements. These standardized inspection requirements are defined in the RFI attachments.

6. LIMITS ON SUBCONTRACTING: in accordance with VAAR 852.219-73 VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside under 852.219-73(d)(1)(5), it states:

(1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract.

(5) Subcontracting. An SDVOSB subcontractor must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be certified and listed in the SBA certification database to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6.

The objective of this acquisition is to procure Brand Name transponders to deploy moorings equipped with various scientific sensors in the Southern Ocean to collect ocean circulation and backscatter data over broad timescales. These sub-surface moorings remain deployed for more than a year at a time, providing a cost-effective mechanism for collecting data. To recover them, we require acoustic transponders to trigger a release mechanism (Port LF transponder). Since 2018, the U.S. AMLR Program has managed an inventory of 19 Edgetech Port LF transponders. We require 5 more to meet our legislative mandate, along with accessories outlined above. In order to be interchangeable, all equipment must function with the same transducer, tandem assembly kits, tandem chains, and battery packs. To ensure compatibility and avoid the financial burden caused by mismatched equipment, new transponders must be purchased directly from EdgeOne (Edgetech).

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes technical data and cost information, sufficient detail, and convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to meet the requirement. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government.

BACKGROUND

In early 2024, based on the outcomes and recommendations from industry-led studies assessing the availability and feasibility of potential solutions to fulfil the AFSC Capability Requirements, the North Atlantic Council approved the AFSC Technical Concept and its incremental implementation. This concept outlines a vision where surveillance assets, tactical control assets, and effectors can connect seamlessly and respond dynamically to changing operational situations and where manned and unmanned systems are able to act in synergy leveraging manned-unmanned teaming capabilities. This AFSC System of Systems will be able to operate across all environments, from benign, to contested, and into denied battlespace, ensuring a lower risk to the manned assets.

The expected retirement of NATO&rsquo;s Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) fleet around 2035 led NATO to initiate the AFSC Concept Stage with the aim to define a new generation of surveillance and control capabilities. Based on the outcomes and recommendations of studies conducted in the Concept Stage, NSPA has defined an AFSC Technical Concept for a distributed multi-domain Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) and wide-area surveillance system of systems employing a wide range of systems and platforms integrated through a robust and adaptive interoperability architecture to allow a variety of flexible system configurations in future multi-domain operations.  Following the anticipated completion of the AFSC Concept Stage in December 2025 will be an immediate start of the Development Stage in January 2026.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

The contractor shall provide Contracted Engineering Support (CES) services to the Project Office to support the initial AFSC Development Stage Phase 1 (2026-2028) activities with a wide range of engineering skills and expertise covering the following technical areas: Cyber;  Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Requirements Management; Systems Architecture Development; Modular Open Systems Approach; Space Operations; Communications; Tactical Data Links; Data Exchange and Interoperability; Modelling and Simulation; Airworthiness; and Lifecycle Cost Management.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government issue a DOE for potential U.S. prime contractors interested in this project. Before the U.S. Government can do so, however, the U.S. Government must approve the U.S. firm for participation in NATO ICB.  U.S. firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.

Minneapolis VAHCS to provide an AE Upgrade Building 222 HVAC.
This procurement will be procured pursuant to the Selection of Architects
and Engineers (formerly known as The Brooks Act) Public Law 92-582, and
as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36.6 and VA
Acquisition Regulations (VAAR) and VA Acquisition Manual (VAAM) Part
836 and M836 respectively.
All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-71, the
total cost of the contract for A-E services must not exceed 6 percent of
the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related
services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-22 (c) - Design
Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement
action. Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly
rated A-E firm selected to complete the design.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED:
The scope of this design work is to replace the failed VRF system currently
installed in Building 222. Building 222 existing HVAC control system will also
need to be removed and replaced with Johnson Controls (JCI) devices for
compatibility with the facility&rsquo;s monitoring systems. The replacement of these
systems will alleviate the need for Facilities Management to continuously
contract services to provide temporary cooling units for conditioned air to
Building 222.
Building 222 was originally constructed in 1904 and is listed on the
Minnesota National Register of Historic Places. The building was last
renovated in 2019, and the project included replacing electrical in the
warehouse area, renovating to create usable workspace, exterior
weatherproofing, upgrades to roads and grounds, and installation of the
VRF split system. Spaces in this building include logistics warehouses,
offices spaces and conference rooms, urgent care tele ICU, information
management, home based health care and primary care. For this project,
the selected Architectural and Engineering Firm (A-E) shall provide a
phasing study which will include schematic design for all affected areas at
Building 222 of the Minneapolis VAHA Fort Snelling Campus. Additionally,
the selected A-E shall provide construction drawings, specifications,
estimates, construction period services and commissioning services for the
HVAC cooling system and building automation replacements at Building
222.
The final deliverable will include in both PDF and CAD format:
1. The A-E shall completely survey all existing spaces affected by the
renovation. Survey shall include architectural, life safety, electrical,
mechanical, structural, and low voltage systems. The drawings supplied by
the VA are not As-Built.
2. The A-E shall use the attached schematic design as the starting point to
develop the new schematic design (35% Design) and PTRP phasing study,
as well as construction drawings (CDs). This will require meetings with staff
to review details of the plan and to gather comments from the staff on the
project. The A-E will budget, at a minimum, four (4) meetings for this
purpose. Comments approved by the VA project manager will be
incorporated into the design. These four meetings are in addition to the
required design charrette meetings, and the required meetings at the 65%,
95%, and 100% design reviews of Construction Documents.
3. The design for the renovation of Building 222 will be completed in two
phases:
a. The first phase will be an effort to collect comments from VA staff on the
new schematic design and best practice model projects, and
b. The second phase will incorporate comments that are approved by the
VA project manager and develop 65%, 95%, 100% and final construction
plans (CD issue) and specifications.
4. The plans and specifications must be detailed adequately to award a
sealed bid construction contract, see section G &ndash; Deliverables, for design
services requirements.
5. The selected A-E designer shall include construction period services
(CPS) to ensure the construction meets code, specifications, VA design
guides and manuals, quality and design intent of the construction drawings
and specifications; see section G &ndash; Deliverables, for minimum CPS
requirements. Provide option years for FY26 &amp; FY27.
6. The A-E shall design the project to incorporate staff relocations or
temporary spaces as required to complete the project.
7. Environmental conditions shall be maintained to adjacent spaces.
8. Energy savings in a priority goal for the VA. The design should
incorporate features to minimize energy use and maximize energy efficiency

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Each firm must demonstrate their qualifications with respect to the selection
criteria listed below. Evaluation criteria (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) are of equal
importance; criterion (F) is of lesser importance than criteria (A), (B), (C), (D) and
(E); and criterion (G) is of least importance and will be used as a tiebreaker
among technically equal firms. SF-330s will be evaluated to determine the most
highly qualified firm/team based on submitted SF-330 responses. Failure to
provide requested data or comply with the instructions in this synopsis and SF-
330 instructions could result in a firm considered being less qualified or
eliminated from consideration. Specific evaluation criteria include:
A. Professional qualifications:
SF-330, Part I, Block E. NCO 23 will consider any information, which may be
pertinent to this criterion, including the following: proposed key personnel
(reference primary discipline list below), professional registration, and
competence, related experiences to accomplish this work, education, and
years with the company. Key personnel shall be permanent employees of
the prime firm/team rather than temporary &ldquo;contract hire&rdquo; employee
arrangements. Failure to provide a balanced workforce in the disciplines
listed could result in the firm being considered not qualified. The combination
of criteria below will be used to determine the ability of the staff to contribute
to the successful completion of project task orders. Firms with greater
breadth of in-house expertise will be rated higher than those needing to hire
sub-consultants. The offeror&rsquo;s team shall include staff members licensed in
the States covering Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISN) 23 found in
the statement of work (SOW) in the following disciplines:
&bull; Architectural Design
&bull; Structural Engineer*
&bull; Mechanical Engineer
&bull; Electrical Engineer
&bull; Cost Estimator
&bull; Commissioning Agent
In addition, the offeror&rsquo;s team shall include staff members in the following
disciplines and shall demonstrate their qualification:
&bull; Project/Program Manager
&bull; Construction Management
&bull; Quality Control Manager
B. Specialized experience and technical competence:
SF-330, Part I, Section F. Region 3 NCO 23 will consider any information
which may be pertinent to this criterion, including the following: specialized
experience and technical competence in the performance of services similar
to those anticipated under this contract in terms of recent and relevant
experience with regard to the project examples described below, as well as
demonstrated experience with VA facility design.
&bull; Example Projects: Submit example design projects in narrative format that
highlight the experience factors listed above. Design project examples
should not exceed two pages each. All experience factors do not have to be
included in a single project. The offeror may submit multiple projects to
demonstrate experience in all relevant types of work, however, do not submit
more than five projects total
a) The narratives of example projects should show contract number, issuing
agency, project name, a current point of contact including telephone and
email information, project scope, size, location, design fees, the total number
of modifications / change orders issued during performance of project, date
of project completion, estimate of construction cost, principal design
elements and features, complexity of the job, challenges faced to include
disagreements regarding design requirements and construction estimates
disputes, and the resolution and results of any challenges faced. In addition,
and if known, list the construction contract award price, and the total number
of construction contract modifications/change orders and their total value.
b) Example projects may be from the private or public sector; however, VA
projects may be rated higher. Projects completed more recently will be
evaluated more advantageously. The design of all example projects must
have been completed within the past four (4) years (prior to the SF-330 due
date for this solicitation). The evaluation will consider the relevancy (design
and construction scope, size and location) of projects identified. For the
purposes of this evaluation the A-E may submit no more than two example
projects which were investigations or studies only. The investigation(s) or
study(ies) must have been completed within the past four (4) years (prior to
the SF-330 due date for this solicitation) as well.
c) Examples of work submitted that do not meet the requirements specified
here will not be evaluated. Failure to provide requested data, accessible
points of contact or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being
considered less qualified and eliminated from further consideration. Identify
any key personnel in SF-330, Part I, Section G that worked on the projects
and their role. Specialized experience and technical competency will be
evaluated for ability to support the range of work required for this contract, as
demonstrated by firm&rsquo;s submitted projects.
C. Capacity:
SF-330, Part I, Block H. Demonstrate how the firm(s) will manage,
coordinate, and administer the work within the prime and among any
teaming partners. Teaming partners to be included by the prime firm in their
response should be clearly identified as such for evaluation purposes and
will later be agreed to during negotiations of any resultant contract. SF-330,
Part II, Block 11 will also be evaluated to assist in determining this factor.
SF-330 Part I Blocks C, D, F and SF-330, Part II will also be evaluated to
support this criterion. NCO 23 will consider any information which may be
pertinent to this criterion, including the following:
&bull; Capacity to perform work in-house and with teaming members.
&bull; Demonstrate active on-going Federal and Non-Federal work (Address
current dollar value of work, number of current projects, management
approach to your on-going work, and how the team will support the work
requirements outlined in this synopsis in addition to current work). Quantify
the A-E teams reserve capacity (percent of available capacity or man hours
available or number of man hours available).
&bull; Greater weight will be given to offerors who provide quantitative data to
support an assertion of sufficient work-load capacity.
D. Construction period services:
SF-330, Part I, Block H. In a two-page narrative, provide supporting
information on the firms experience in construction period services to include
professional field inspections during the construction period, review of
construction submittals, support in answering requests for information during
the construction period, and support of construction contract changes to
include drafting statements of work, and cost estimates.
&bull; Demonstrate how the firm(s) will manage, coordinate, and administer these
services.
&bull; Provide information on technology to be used during field inspections.
&bull; Provide any additional pertinent information relevant to these criteria.
&bull; Greater weight will be given to offerors who provide examples of completed
projects where they&rsquo;ve successfully completed these services in the past 18-
months.
E. Past performance:
SF-330, Block H. For the example projects provided under Specialized
Experience and Technical Competence, in a single page narrative form
provide past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, and
compliance with performance schedules for each example project submitted
under Specialized Experience and Technical Competence. In addition to
past performance information provided, the evaluation will include
information available within the VA, Federal, state, private industry, or other
sources. In addition to the narrative described above, forward the Past
Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) of this synopsis, to each project point of
contact. Completed PPQ forms shall be submitted as part of the firms&rsquo;
proposal package. Firms may include any ratings, letters of appreciation or
performance, awards etc., for relevant experience; however, Federal
database content and PPQs will be evaluated more advantageously.
Reponses will be evaluated to determine firms&rsquo; ability to maintain cost,
schedule, quality, and customer satisfaction.
If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a
project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should
complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ
(Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the
respective project(s). Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under

e5c36a0717444e129040a13bbda59983,6973GH-25-D-Parrot,MSSR Dual Channel Parrot Single Source,"Title of Procurement 

The acquisition of DUAL CHANNEL PARROT, in support of the following Federal Aviation (FAA) system:

-       Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar (MSSR) Interrogator

IFS# 100037583, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Part Number 32164-G35-F02-ES0, Beel Technologies Inc.

Nature of Procurement Action

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers it necessary to acquire MSSR Dual Channel Parrot units.  The acquisition source is Beel Technologies Inc. under single source authority.

Description of Supplies/Services 

The FAA has a continuing requirement to support a quantity of 72 commissioned MSSR Interrogators.  Each MSSR is collocated with Airport Surveillance Radar model 11 (ASR-11) radar.  Both systems are integrated to provide primary and secondary radar information to terminal air traffic control sites. 

The Dual Channel Parrot replicates aircraft transponders and it is used for confidence checking of the MSSR system.  This Single Source Justification is for acquisition of MSSR Dual Channel Parrots.

Authority

The FAA proposes to procure Dual Channel Parrots on a single source basis by AMS policy section 3.2.2.4, Single-Source-Selection, in that the acquisition allows for standardization (previous FAA contracts allowed the installation of Beel Dual Channel Parrots in FAA and Alaska radar sites, while current FAA contract will allow the installation of Army radar sites), and Beel Technologies Inc. is the only source capable of meeting the FAA requirement within the time required, allowing the Government to start receiving new parrots just a few of months after contract award, which is necessary and important to support the FAA&rsquo;s mission.

Rationale Supporting Use of a Single Source 

The legacy MSSR Dual Channel Parrots were originally fielded in the mid-2000s.  The equipment was designed by Raytheon and purchased under contract F19628-96-D-0038.  As of 2018, Raytheon stated that it cannot manufacture new legacy MSSR Dual Channel Parrot due to obsolescence.  In addition, even though the legacy units are included in Raytheon Repair contract 6973GH-24-D-00031, Raytheon can only provide limited repair services.  Any units shipped to Raytheon for repairs are usually declared Beyond Economical Repair (BER) and returned to the FAALC in repairable status (an example is serial number G020034; GIAI number 060297099999999999999998891324; RMA number 300021084; Delivery Order 6973GH-20-F-00346P00003, which was declared BER by Raytheon). Finally, Raytheon stopped providing replacement price for the legacy MSSR Dual Channel Parrot in the 2019 Evaluation-Repair-Replace Schedule.

The FAA does not have the technical knowledge and facilities required to manufacture legacy MSSR Dual Channel Parrots.  The FAA does not have access or rights to the design data (which is proprietary to Raytheon) to provide to other vendors to establish competition for this acquisition.

The legacy MSSR Dual Channel Parrots are repaired by the FAALC.  During the June 2022 MSSR Program Management Review (PMR), the Logistics Center identified the legacy MSSR Dual Channel Parrots as Critical Item with Immediate Supportability issues.

The MSSR Dual Channel Parrot is part of the Program Office ASR-11 Sustainment 3 initiative.  The approved Implementation Strategy and Planning Document (ISPD) version 1.2 (03/31/2022) states:


	&ldquo;LRU Description &ndash; Acts as a transponder located externally to the ground station site, providing a target at a fixed location for continual verification of range and azimuth accuracy. 
	Shortfall &ndash; The PARROT cannot be purchased from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  Serviceable inventory is zero (0), with nine (9) backorders.  EOS will be reached as early as September 2022.
	Scope &ndash; The investment initiative solution will entail a procurement of COTS HW and is not expected to include any SW modifications to integrate the COTS HW and is not expected to include any SW modifications to integrate the COTS HW into the ASR-11 system.  FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) depot inventory levels will be replenished to sustain this LRU until Sustainment 4, in 2026.&rdquo;


The ASR-11 Program Office has provided funding for the acquisition of a quantity of 10 MSSR Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Dual Channel Parrots via Service Order (SO) AJM-25-001-24360.  In addition, the National Airspace System (NAS) Defense liaison (AJW-B720) has established SO funding AJW-25-001-25030 for the acquisition of 6 units to support the Alaska National Airspace System (NAS).  This brings the total quantity of 16 units to be acquired during the base year of the contract. 

The FAA will continue to use the ASR-11/MSSR collocated systems to support Air Traffic Controller Operations through the year 2029 and beyond. The FAA is planning the acquisition of 41 Dual Channel Parrots under the option year 1 of the contract.  This will satisfy the FAA&rsquo;s requirement for MSSR Dual Channel Parrot operations in a long-term basis. 

Market Analysis

A Market Survey was released on sam.gov under the Notice ID 6973GH-25-S-Parrot and Name MSSR Dual Channel Parrot (original published date 3/19/2025 and original response date 4/2/2025).  No responses were received from industry.

Contract 6973GH-23-D-00086 was awarded to Beel Technologies Inc. on 6/1/2023.  This contract allowed for acquisition of a total of 20 (base year) and 32 (option year 1) Dual Channel Parrots. 

Other Facts Supporting Use of Single Source

The FAA Logistics Center awarded DTFAAC-13-P-04283 to Beel Technologies Inc. for the purchase of 3 Dual Channel Parrots.  The 3 units were funded via SO AJW-13-001-25637 and delivered to support the Alaska NAS.     

The FAA Logistics Center awarded 6973GH-21-P-00599 to Beel Technologies Inc. for the purchase of 1 Dual Channel Parrot.  This unit was released to Second Level Engineering (AJW-147).  The purpose of the acquisition was for AJW-147 to test the Beel product in an MSSR radar environment.  The testing occurred in the following location:  Airport Radar Systems Building 217, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, OK. 

Beel Technologies Inc. has been building COTS parrots for many years and has provided ready and proven technologies to Governments around the world and industry (including companies that fabricate radar equipment).  The acquisition of COTS equipment from Beel Technologies Inc. would allow the FAALC to comply with the approved ISPD and Program Office ASR-11 Sustainment 3 initiative.

Additionally, the acquisition of Dual Channel Parrots from Beel Technologies Inc. will allow the FAA to continue to mitigate Immediate/Critical Supportability Issues as reported in quarterly PMRs.  The risk flag for the legacy item is &ldquo;Insufficient spares in inventory to support the field and obsolescence&rdquo;. 

Legacy MSSR Dual Channel Parrot (IFS# 015344111):


	Annual demand =   13        
	Serviceable stock = 5          Decommissioned equipment that became available with Beel unit installations
	Repairable stock = 13         Decommissioned equipment that became available with Beel unit installations


The acquisition of Dual Channel Parrots is a priority for the Agency.  Delaying the acquisition would negatively impact the degraded FAALC support posture.  Beel Technologies Inc. possesses the expertise, decades of market penetration, and the available product to support the current requirement.  There is no other known supplier of parrots (per Market Survey Response and previous FAA acquisition contracts) that can satisfy the current requirement.

 PART 1   PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A. GENERAL

This project (NRM) will engage an engineering firm to provide a complete design for a new renovation/expansion of the BECVAMC Boiler Plant.

The design of this project will address, but not be limited to, the following items:

1. Provide a professional survey and site assessment to identify feasible options for a new boiler plant facility that will integrate into the existing steam piping infrastructure and campus while providing adequate room around the building for tractor-trailer deliveries, employee parking, and occasional crane work. Engineering investigative work should include, but not limited to soil studies, vibration studies, electrical load testing, and any other test or study deemed applicable to create a complete and accurate design. The A/E shall present three possible boiler plant options (one option shall be for renovation/expansion of existing facility; two options will be for an entirely new boiler plant at a selected location on site) listing the pros and cons of each option that VA engineering personnel will use to make a final decision.  The new boiler plant shall be approximately 8,000 square feet. 

2.  Design a new N+1 boiler plant facility that can support a peak steam demand during the coldest time period of the year. The new boilers must be capable of operating on #2 fuel oil and natural gas. Peripheral equipment and utilities, such as but not limited to, pumps and other vessels, electrical, water, and natural gas will require replacement or modifications to meet the new demands. This project will provide all services required for planning and design related to installation, electrical, mechanical work, and architectural modifications to meet the service requirements.

3.  Design of a complete boiler blow-down heat recovery system, steam blanketing, and a simplified control system. All steam materials (valves, fittings, traps, etc) specified in all A/E plumbing designs shall be forged steel, not cast.

4.  Design shall include a study of the current steam system, consider future steam capacity, and system pressure increase needs as well. The review shall include the recommendations for any replacement, repairs and/or upgrades required for the existing heat exchanger and steam piping layout in order to support the new boilers. This report shall be included in the contract documents. The A/E shall coordinate and collaborate with contract holders involved in the steam line replacement project to ensure seamless integration and execution of project requirements. 

5.  The A/E team members shall have previous experience in the design of boiler plant facilities for a VA medical center. A/E must provide documentation of at least three boiler plant facility designs with references, names, and phone numbers.

6.  Design must provide all necessary Structural, Civil, Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing trades with estimates and drawings that include demolition activities. Provide documentation, design, drafting and quantity calculations for the commissioning of the entire steam-generation system, not just the new boilers. Commissioning of all components of new or existing will be accomplished under a separate contract.

7.  Design shall include asbestos/lead survey report and include a remediation plan in the contract documents. In the development of a remediation plan, the A/E shall retain the services of a Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) to provide expertise in all aspects of identifying, assessing, and making recommendations concerning the management of asbestos and/or lead.

8.  A phasing plan is critical and should be prepared early to assure no negative impact to the boiler plant operation. Downtime of systems should be kept at a minimum. The plan shall address provisions for continuation of service during outages.

9.  The A/E shall take into account design requirements to reduce operations and maintenance costs and limit operational downtime.

10.  The A/E shall incorporate field-verified utility locations as part of their design submittal.

11.  Design shall be governed by the applicable VA and national codes and standards. This includes, but not limited to, the VA Steam Generation Systems Design Manual and VA specification section 23 21 11  Boiler Plant Piping Systems , 23 52 39  Fire-Tube Boilers , including start-up and testing requirements, and current EHRM requirements as it pertains to the inclusion of IT equipment and space.

13.  Attend all necessary project meetings and field inspections.

14.  Make recommendations on the construction phasing to minimize the impact in regular operations near the area including impact in utility shutdowns. A phasing plan is critical and should be prepared early to assure no negative impact to the boiler plant operation. Downtime of systems should be kept at a minimum. The plan shall address provisions for continuation of service during outages.

15.  The A/E shall coordinate with the Veterans Administration Central Office (VACO) to obtain approval and certification of boiler design before each submittal.

16.  Design shall include the demolition of all steam equipment, including peripherals, and piping deemed obsolete as part of this project.  Other utility components, such as but not limited to, electrical, air, and natural gas deemed obsolete shall also be included in the demolition design.  

17.  Design shall install facilities that eliminate a two-boiler shutdown due to a single point of failure (SPOF).  If a SPOF is noted and cannot be avoided due to feasibility, safety, cost, etc., the Engineering firm shall formally notify the VA CO/COR of the details and provide a description of the risk associated with the item.  VA CO/COR will evaluate the risk, with input from VA national program offices, and provide approval for SPOF if risk is deemed acceptable.

18.  Engineering firm is required to provide space and necessary utility tie-ins for an emergency rental boiler as part of this design.

B. BACKGROUND

As the Beckley VAMC continues to expand and grow, and VA guidelines are updated or established, the steam demand on our boiler plant keeps increasing. While the current boiler plant is still functional, the capacity and space are undersized according to current industry standards.  A new/renovated modern boiler plant is needed that will meet current demands of today and be capable of handling the steam requirements of our expanding medical center.

C. GENERAL SCOPE

1. Design a new boiler plant facility that complies with the N+1 requirement. The engineering firm shall review capacity needs at Beckley VAMC, including but not limited to, future growth and current steam demand requirements, to assist in determining boiler plant and utility sizing. The new building/renovation will be located on an area of the campus that allows the new piping to effectively integrate into the existing steam distribution system while providing ample room for tractor trailer traffic and occasional crane work. Possible locations will be identified by the A/E through a professional site survey and investigative engineering work. 

2.  Steam distribution and condensate piping shall be evaluated on the BECVAMC campus for integrity and sizing and replaced as required.  The steam distribution layout through the facility should also be reviewed and remediated as necessary. A plan for future boiler plant expansion, such as the addition of a new boiler, will need to be provided to the VA as part of the design package.

2.  Detail the demolition work required to remove the steam generating equipment in the existing boiler plant. 


D. SCHEDULE:

cddec588b1b1540299af3a1482f71745-re,RFQ1753543,Army  Data Integration for Ground Systems (DIGS),"The General Services Administration (GSA), on behalf of the United States Army, is conducting market research to support the Product Manager for Army Watercraft Systems (PdM AWS). This initiative focuses on developing a Data Integration for Ground Systems (DIGS) Predictive Logistics (PL) Solution. The overarching goal of this project is to enhance the operational efficiency and effectiveness of Army maintenance, repair, and supply operations. PdM AWS plays a critical role as the Life Cycle Manager for the global Army watercraft fleet, ensuring that systems are safe, suitable, and supportable for Warfighters/Mariners across various operational environments.

The DIGS PL Solution aims to provide an expeditionary sustainment capability that can digitize, automate, and streamline processes in both connected and contested network environments. This software solution must be capable of full integration with existing systems such as the Army's Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM), Interactive Authoring and Display Software (IADS), Electronic Maintenance System (EMS), and Global Combat Support System – Army (GCSS-A). By achieving seamless integration with these systems, the solution will enable more efficient logistics operations and predictive maintenance capabilities.

Through this market survey, PdM AWS seeks to identify potential solutions that meet these requirements while ensuring compliance with confidentiality obligations under U.S. law.

03b58bdbd6b9443d97cf731d484d8e2b,68HERC25R0144,C--Intent to Sole Source Facility Mechanical Design,"Synopsis - Notice of Intent to Sole SourceDesign Services for Mechanical System and Roofing Integration, Ada, OklahomaProposed Solicitation Number: 68HERC25R0144The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Cincinnati Acquisition Division (located at 26 Martin Luther King Dr. W, Cincinnati, OH 45268) intends to solicit I DESIGN AND PLANNING, LLC (iDesign) (2531 Ridge RD STE 100, White Lake, Michigan, 48383-1750) on a sole source basis for a new firm-fixed price contract for the design of Mechanical Systems and Roofing Integration at the Robert Kerr Environmental Research Center. This sole source solicitation will be made under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The design requirement requires the seamless integration of a newly proposed mechanical design with the recently upgraded mechanical systems designed by iDesign. The mechanical design will build upon a concept design prepared by iDesign. Therefore, iDesign is in a unique position to provide design integration of the new mechanical and roofing systems into the current mechanical system.The following is a partial listing of the requirements for this project:•	Completion of mechanical conception design to 100% construction documents. (final IFC set, stamped drawings). Final 100% submission to include cost estimate.•	Prepare Design Alternates to replace roof at the Main Lab building  & Library and Conference Center (LCC) (Alternates to be awarded at the Government’s discretion)•	Refine mechanical, electrical, plumbing (MEP), structural, and civil elements as needed.•	Integrate vendor data from pre-purchased mechanical equipment •	Develop detailed load calculations, layouts, and equipment schedules.•	Coordinate with architectural and structural disciplines.•	Develop detailed engineering drawings, specifications, and schedules.•	Perform quality control (QC) reviews to ensure compliance with project requirements.•	Conduct interdisciplinary clash detection and coordination.•	Complete all final specifications, drawings, and submittal requirements.•	Provide a permit-ready document package.•	Address final owner and stakeholder comments before issuing documents.•	The energy model should be performed in accordance with ASHRAE 90.1 and the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction. The following is a partial listing of codes, standards, and regulatory references that apply to the Project:•	All applicable federal, state and local standards and regulations•	All Oklahoma state, fire, safety and health regulations•	All applicable NFPA Codes•	OSHA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations•	EPA Facilities Manuals (Volumes 1 – 4)•	GSA Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service (P100)•	National Electric Code (NEC)•	Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS)•	American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)•	National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB)•	State of Oklahoma ICC Adopted Codes•	American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineering (ASHRAE)•	Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’ National Association (SMACNA)•	Guiding Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings Conclusion:FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.The nature of this acquisition requires the U.S. EPA to use the authority cited because of the complex nature of integrating the new design into the current design and roofing systems. iDesign is uniquely qualified to provide the ongoing design services given their past role providing the design services for the currently upgraded mechanical system. The utilization of a different A/E firm would likely require additional engineering support and additional lead time to become familiar with the status of the design work as well as existing site conditions.  A different firm would be forced to interpret the various elements of iDesign’s existing concept design to respond to questions raised by construction contractor.  This would result in a longer timeline for the completion and additional cost to the government.  A sole source award to iDesign will allow construction to continue with no disruption and effort lost. A disruption and requirements delay are likely if a new contractor were brought in. iDesign is also uniquely qualified for this work because of their in-depth knowledge of the EPA Robert S. Kerr Environmental Research Center facilities. This knowledge is critical to minimize costs, keep the Robert S. Kerr laboratories operational and the building occupant’s safe during the design integration. Finally—and critically—iDesign is currently providing construction administration services for ongoing construction work at the Ada facilities. To inject a new A/E firm, with new engineers and architects, into the existing, fluid construction project is extremely impractical. Questions would arise as to which A/E firm is responsible for reviewing and finalizing changes flowing from the new design, or for certifying that the new designs do not compromise features of existing design. Assigning liability for any potential issues would be very difficult. All of these potential challenges could result in construction delays or building closures. However, the research performed at the EPA Robert S. Kerr campus is mission critical and having a disruption in services, which could potentially close the labs for a period of time, cannot be permitted. As the continuation of design oversight, for the necessary laboratory consolidation, and consistency of the known consolidation requirements, it is in the best interest of the Government to award this follow-on contract to iDesign. Utilization of iDesign avoids all of the pitfalls enumerated above.This requirement will utilize FAR Part 36. The product service code is C1DB, Architect and Engineering – Construction: Laboratories. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is NAICS Code 541330 Engineering Services with a small business size of $25.5M. The estimated construction cost of the work resulting from the design is under $10M. The anticipated Period of Performance is 7 months. Contract award is anticipated to be made Spring 2025.THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Notwithstanding, all responsible sources that believe they are capable of meeting the EPA’s requirement may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation—that must address the outlined requirements above—which shall be considered by the agency. Such documentation must be submitted to the Contracting Officer by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on May 1, 2025.

The focus of this solicitation is on the inspection and evaluation of flood barriers at Langley Air Force Base (AFB). The overall goal of this initiative is to ensure that these barriers are operationally ready and capable of effectively protecting critical infrastructure from potential flooding. By engaging with industry experts, the USAF seeks to gain insights into best practices and innovative approaches that could enhance the maintenance and functionality of these essential structures.

The specific work requested involves a comprehensive visual evaluation and inspection of 26 flood barriers located at Langley AFB. This task will require a detailed assessment to determine the current condition of each barrier, identifying any defects or issues that may compromise their effectiveness. The contractor will be responsible for producing an in-depth inspection report that outlines their findings, along with recommendations for corrective actions such as maintenance, repairs, or replacements where necessary. This report will play a crucial role in guiding future efforts to maintain the operational readiness and reliability of these flood protection systems.

In addition to visual inspections, the contractor's responsibilities include verifying various structural aspects such as sealing surfaces, frame alignment, wear and tear on components like gaskets and seals, as well as checking for any signs of oxidation or rust on metal parts. The integrity of bolts, welds, gauges, hoses, structural steel plates, and toggle latches must also be thoroughly examined to ensure they meet required standards.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA/Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC)) is hereby soliciting information from potential sources for the Commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Destination Contract (CLDC).  

As NASA plans for the retirement of the International Space Station (ISS) at the end of the decade, the ability of private industry to take on the task of providing routine utilization of LEO and maintaining a continuous U.S. presence in space is of vital importance to both NASA and U.S. goals.  

In a multiphase strategy, JSC&rsquo;s Commercial LEO Development Program (CLDP) is helping spur the development of new LEO space destinations and supporting systems from private industry. See link here for additional information: https://www.nasa.gov/leo-economy/low-earth-orbit-economy/.  These systems may include end-to-end services such as the in-orbit destination, visiting vehicles, and supporting launch vehicles and ground systems. 

NASA awarded Phase 1 Space Act Agreements to promote early design maturation of safe, reliable, and cost-effective commercial orbital platforms and capabilities. The Commercial Destinations Free Flyer (CDFF) agreements are held by Blue Origin and Starlab Space. The Collaborations to Commercial Space Capabilities (CCSC-2) agreements are held by Northrop Grumman, Blue Origin, Sierra Space, SpaceX, Special Aerospace Service (SAS), Think Orbital, and Vast Space. Additional Commercial LEO Destination (CLD) development efforts are being performed under the agency&rsquo;s Commercial Destination ISS (CDISS) contract, which was awarded to Axiom Space.  

NASA is currently developing Phase 2 requirements for CLD capabilities that would be able to support NASA astronauts, international astronauts, and other spaceflight participants safely in LEO on a commercially-owned and operated space station. For Phase 2, NASA intends to issue the CLDP requirements on a separate Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 Firm-Fixed Price solicitation to procure these end-to-end services.   

NASA plans to release a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in the summer of 2025 under NAICS code 336414, Guided Missile and Space Vehicle Manufacturing (size standard of 1500 employees). NASA anticipates issuing the solicitation as a full and open competition available to any capable offeror. Participation in CLD Phase 1 is not a pre-requisite to compete in Phase 2.  

In accordance with the 2020 National Space Policy, which aims &ldquo;to promote a robust domestic commercial space industry and strengthen U.S. leadership as the country of choice for conducting commercial space activities,&rdquo; NASA plans to purchase CLD services from a United States provider.  

Additional technical and strategic information along with a preliminary schedule can be found in the CLDC Acquisition Website: https://www.nasa.gov/johnson/jsc-procurement/cldc/.   

Please note, the documents/links on the CLDC Acquisition Website listed above are for information and planning purposes to allow industry the opportunity to comment and to promote competition.

NAIHS-ACQ-09 UNAUTHORIZED COMMITMENTS SEP 2023

(a) Definitions.

Contracting Officer means a person with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make related determination and findings.

Ratification means the act of approving an unauthorized commitment by an official who has the authority to do so.

Unauthorized Commitment (UAC) means an agreement that is not binding solely because the Government representative who made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the Government.

(b) Policy.

The Government is not bound by agreements with, or contractual commitments made to, prospective contractors by individuals who do not have delegated contracting authority. Unauthorized commitments do not follow the appropriate process for the expenditure of Government funds. Consequently, the Government may not be able to ratify certain actions, putting a contractor at risk for taking direction from a Federal official other than the contracting officer (see FAR 1.602-1) Government employees responsible for unauthorized commitments are subject to disciplinary action. Contractors perform at their own risk when accepting direction from unauthorized officials. Failure to follow statutory and regulatory processes for the expenditure of Government funds is a very serious matter.

(c) Procedure.

Any agreement, modification, or change to a contractual agreement made by a government personnel who lack authority will be deemed an unauthorized commitment.  The Government is not liable to the Contractor or under the terms of the contract, financially or otherwise &ndash; unless the unauthorized commitment successfully passes the ratification process.

The ratification process does not have any lead time, nor does the Government make any promise that an unauthorized commitment will be ratified and, therefore, the Contractor would be paid.  The Contractor proceeds at its own risk if any of the terms of the contract are altered, changed, or modified without the written concurrence by a Contracting Officer.

This initiative seeks to enhance the operational capabilities of various offices within the Coast Guard by providing expert contractor support in systems engineering, requirements management, operations research, and data analytics. The overarching goal is to ensure that the U.S. Coast Guard can effectively manage and develop its capability requirements in alignment with DHS standards and strategic objectives.

The contract focuses on providing comprehensive support across several key areas within the Coast Guard. These include the Office of Emerging Operational Capabilities, Shore Infrastructure Requirements, C5I Capabilities, Requirements & Analysis, Research, Innovation & Integration, Aviation Forces, Specialized Capabilities, Boat Forces, Shore Forces, Cutter Forces, and Cyberspace Forces. The aim is to facilitate these offices in addressing their specific operational needs through a structured approach to systems engineering and data-driven decision-making processes.

A significant aspect of this solicitation is the transition towards a more digital-centric approach in managing operational requirements. The Requirements Division within CG-7R7 currently employs a document-centric system for executing system engineering functions but recognizes the industry's shift towards Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and digital environments. Consequently, there is a need for expertise in establishing and maintaining a digital Requirements Management System (RMS) that will enable more efficient elicitation, documentation, traceability, and change management of operational requirements.",Federal Acquisition Service,2025-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,2025-04-04,2025-04-11 17:00:00+00:00,2025-04-11,,Sources Sought,,541330,Engineering Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEDERAL ACQUISITION SERVICE,,Boston,MA,02222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ad2995856b885d70952531f67c3817f8-re,,,,,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/r-RFQ1751505-re,https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/seller/prepare-quote/RFQ1751505?contractNumber=
