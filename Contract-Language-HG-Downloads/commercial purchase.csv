7ac6b4f975784bd5a39e69050142ab1a,W912NS25Q8511,Aircraft Repair and Modernization Parts - Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) MOARNG,"The Missouri Army National Guard (MOARNG) is issuing a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.603, FAR 13, and supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; capabilities statements are being requested and a request for quote will not be issued under this solicitation.

Utilizing FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the MOARNG intends to issue Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPAs) for a broad class of aircraft repair and modernization parts for delivery to the MOARNG Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depot (AVCRAD) in Springfield, MO. The following solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2025-04 dated 11 June 2025.

OBJECTIVE: The government is looking for qualified companies to provide various aircraft repair and modernization parts in support of depot level aviation maintenance operations of the MOARNG AVCRAD. The AVCRAD&rsquo;s mission is to provide depot level aviation maintenance to support the operational readiness of aviation assets across the Army National Guard. The primary airframes supported by these facilities are UH-60, CH-47, UH-72, and AH-64. Multiple award blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) will be established with highly qualified distributors and manufacturers that have a history of successfully providing aircraft repair and modernization parts and who carry stock of components for the UH-60, CH-47, UH-72, and AH-64.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413 - Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing. The applicable Product and Service Code (PSC) is 1520 - Aircraft, Rotary Wing. This solicitation for multiple award BPAs is open to small businesses and also large businesses. Orders under the BPAs will be subject to the small business set-aside policies in FAR 13.003(b)(1) and FAR 19.502-2(a).

Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is an agreement intended to support a streamlined method for acquiring products or services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources. The intent is to eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. All funded requirements issued under the terms and conditions of a BPA are called &ldquo;Orders.&rdquo; The establishment of a BPA does not guarantee orders will be made. There is no minimum guaranteed quantity or value. The government is obligated only to the extent of authorized purchases actually made under the BPA. The government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice. The government may request a site visit with any offeror to establish acceptability. A minimum of one annual review of all BPA holders will occur, in order to ensure standards are met.

Each BPA awarded will have up to a five (5) year ordering period with a maximum ceiling of $999,000, whichever comes first. Each order under the BPAs will not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. Orders below the micro-purchase threshold may be placed without providing for fair opportunity. All orders will include an individual Purchase Description and, if over the micro-purchase threshold, the ordering activity will survey at least three BPA holders by reviewing the catalogs or parts lists or by requesting quotations from at least three BPA holders reasonably expected to be able to provide a quote. BPA holders will be welcome to provide their updated catalog or parts list to the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer on a regular basis.

The anticipated BPAs will be unpriced in support of a broad class of supplies within the NAICS code stated above, but the exact items, quantities, and delivery requirements are not known in advance and may vary considerably. Either party has the choice to terminate or re-negotiate an agreement provided a 30-day notification is given. Pricing must be determined fair and reasonable on individual orders under the BPAs.

In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(g) which is incorporated by reference, the Government intends to evaluate capabilities statements and issue BPA(s) without discussions. However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary.

Vendors must have a current registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov as of the date of award determination to be eligible for award. Offeror shall ensure all representations and certifications are current in SAM as a condition of award.

METHOD OF INVOICING: Contractor invoicing for completed orders shall be through the DoD&rsquo;s Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) system.

SUBMISSION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:

Capability statements should include the following at a minimum.


	A summary of the company&rsquo;s capabilities to provide a wide variety of aircraft repair parts to support the operational readiness of UH-60, CH-47, UH-72, and AH-64 aircraft. The capabilities statement shall include your company&rsquo;s catalog or list of parts in stock that support the stated objective. If available, the vendor&rsquo;s catalog or list of parts available should include product country of origin information. Since many aircraft parts require air worthiness certification, please provide examples of parts available or sold with air worthiness certifications (FAA Form 8130-3).
	Past performance examples of the company&rsquo;s relevant sales of aviation repair and modernization parts. For example, provide the applicable government contract numbers and/or redacted commercial purchase orders that demonstrate the company&rsquo;s dependability to provide quality supplies at fair and reasonable prices and show that the company has provided numerous purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.


Capability Statement submissions, including vendor&rsquo;s past performance information, should be emailed to douglas.m.young4.civ@army.mil and stephen.j.miller1.civ@army.mil with a subject line of &ldquo;Business Name - &ldquo;Aircraft Repair and Modernization Parts BPA Capabilities Statement&rdquo;&rdquo;

Vendors may be evaluated and BPAs may be established as the capability statements are received. Please do not wait until the closing date on this notice to submit your capabilities statement.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

Submissions will be evaluated based on the quality and perceived effectiveness of the vendor&rsquo;s capabilities statement to support the MOARNG&rsquo;s objective stated above.  The government&rsquo;s assessment of the vendor&rsquo;s qualifications and capabilities will assign a rating of &quot;Outstanding,&quot; &quot;Good,&quot; &quot;Acceptable,&quot; &quot;Marginal,&quot; or &quot;Unacceptable.&quot;

Vendors will be evaluated on the relevancy/applicability of their past performance in supplying aviation repair and modernization parts. The MOARNG may use data provided in the vendor&rsquo;s submission and data obtained from other sources, such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS), SAM, or similar systems. The government&rsquo;s assessment of the vendor&rsquo;s past performance will assign a rating of &quot;Substantial Confidence,&quot; &quot;Satisfactory Confidence,&quot; &quot;Limited Confidence,&quot; &quot;No Confidence,&quot; or &quot;Unknown Confidence (Neutral).&quot;

The government intends to enter into BPAs with responsible companies that have the capabilities to successfully supply a broad class of aircraft parts in a timely manner. Vendors that do not meet all of the desired characteristics or that provide alternative solutions while still meeting the overall objectives of the acquisition may still be submitted for technical evaluation. The government retains the sole right to determine technical acceptability of vendors&rsquo; submissions and to reject any capabilities statements it deems does not meet the objectives and/or required characteristics.

BASIS FOR AWARD: BPAs will be issued to the responsive, responsible offeror(s) whose submission demonstrates the capabilities to meet the objectives identified within this solicitation and demonstrates relevant and recent (within 36 months) past performance that is assessed as &ldquo;satisfactory confidence&rdquo; or better. The Contracting Officer will determine the actual number of BPAs to be issued based on the quality of responses received and what is deemed most advantageous to the MOARNG.

COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT: Submit questions via email to the Contract Specialist at douglas.m.young4.civ@army.mil and the Contracting Officer at stephen.j.miller1.civ@army.mil no later than 13 August 2025 at 3:00 pm Central Daylight Time (CDT).  The solicitation number shall be identified in the subject line of the email submission.

Vendors interested in being considered for a BPA shall submit the following documents, via email, no later than 3:00 pm CDT, 28 August 2025.

ply with the recordkeeping requirements in this contract clause, the records and
documents shall also be maintained in compliance with the confidentiality requirements of the GINA, section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and/or ADA as described in 29 CFR 1635.9, 41 CFR 60-741.23(d), and 29 CFR 1630.14(c)(1), respective

ct, the Family and Medical Leave Act, E.O. 13658, their respective implementing
regulations, or any other applicable law.

(j) Interference/discrimination.

(iv) Reducing an employee's accrued paid sick leave by more than the amount of such leave used;

(v) Transferring an employee to work on contracts not covered by the E.O. to prevent the accrual or use of paid sick leave;

(vi) Disclosing confidential information contained in certification or other documentation provided to verify the need to use paid sick leave; or

(vii) Making the use of paid sick leave contingent on the employee's finding a replacement worker or the fulfillment of the Contractor's operational needs.

(2) The Contractor shall not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee for--

(i) Using, or attempting to use, paid sick leave as provided for under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR part 13;

(iv) Informing any other person about his or her rights under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR part 13.

(k) Notice. The Contractor shall notify all employees performing work on or in connection with a contract covered by the E.O. of the paid sick leave requirements of E.O. 13706, 29 CFR part 13, and this clause by posting a notice provided by the D

seen by employees. Contractors that customarily post notices to employees electronically may post the notice electronically, provided such electronic posting is displayed prominently on any Web site that is maintained by the Contractor, whether e
xternal or internal, and customarily used for notices to employees about terms
and conditions of employment.

(l) Disputes concerning labor standards. Disputes related to the application of E.O. 13706 to this contract shall not be subject to the general disputes clause of the contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of
the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 13. Disputes within the meaning of

nts (Construction) statute, and are to be performed in whole or in part in the United

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  The Government will award on the basis of price unless the Contracting Officer is aware of past performance information related to the low price quote which indicates that quote may not represent best value.  In that case, the Government reserves the right to consider the

past performance of other quotes, conduct a price, past performance tradeoff, and award to other than the lowest price quote.

      (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

      (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer&rsquo;s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

70Z04918RFI000016
Disclaimer and Important Notes: This posting is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested vendors and is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. This posting is not a Request for Proposals or a Request for Quotations, and it is not considered to be a commitment by the Government to award a contract nor is the Government responsible for any costs incurred in furnishing information provided under this RFI. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this RFI or Government use of any information provided. Further, the Coast Guard is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response to this RFI. The Government reserves the right to use any information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate, including using technical information provided by respondents in any resultant solicitation. Responses will assist the Government in determining the availability of potential solutions and commercial products in the market. At this time no solicitation exists; therefore, do Not Request a Copy of the Solicitation. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
Requirement: United States Coast Guard (USCG) vessels require updated electronic charts in ELECTRONIC NAUTICAL CHARTS (ENC) and RASTER NAUTICAL CHARTS (RNC) format for their areas of operation, which includes U.S., Canadian, Latin American, and Caribbean waters, as well as other select areas. The Electronic Charts provide source data to Coast Guard Command and Control Systems which are critical to the direct fulfillment of military and intelligence missions, as well as safe navigation.
The primary system supported is the Coast Guards Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) as well as secondary systems such as the Coast Guard Electronic Chart System (CG-ECS) and TRANSAS. Most electronic navigational charts for the U.S. waters are available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) or the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Charts for non-U.S. waters will need to be acquired from or produced on the authority of various International Hydrographic Offices such as the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO). To support this requirement, the Coast Guard is seeking monthly distribution of updated charts for these geographic areas, delivered on CD-ROM at set intervals and times, to USCG vessels for use with their navigation systems.
The Coast Guard's goal is to ensure that USCG vessels are provided with the most current and up-to-date electronic navigational charts available. By utilizing the services of a commercial contractor who is familiar with both International and United States electronic charting standards, the Coast Guard believes it can more effectively and efficiently provide updated navigational charts to USCG vessels and overcome inconsistencies that can occur from the constant changing of personnel and the broad range of computer skills.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
 
(2) 
 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ""doing business as"" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:
 
(A) Change the name in the SAM database; 
 
(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;
 
(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ""Suspension of Payment"" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
 
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ""Suspension of payment"" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
 
(u) Unauthorized Obligations. 
 
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
 
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.

     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ""doing business as"" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ""Suspension of Payment"" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ""Suspension of payment"" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(a) This is a full-and-open solicitation. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government utilizing the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process.

Award will be made to the offeror whose price is lowest among all proposals that were deemed to be technically acceptable. The requirements within FAR 13.106-2 shall apply to the evaluation.
The following are the evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process: 1. Price2. Technical Acceptability, as determined by the following subfactors:
Subfactor 1. Certification that the Jobsite Supervisor is a licensed electrician (in accordance with SOW Paragraph 13).

Technical Acceptability for all offerors will be rated on an ""acceptable"" or ""unacceptable"" basis by designated technical experts within 374 CS. (ii) If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph 2, a Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then evaluate the next low offeror in the same manner to determine if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, which will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
