87213920354c19d10261377da7646dcc,RFI-NOAA-Aircraft,"NOAA High Altitude Jet Aircraft, with Modifications","Disclaimer
This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), for the purpose of determining market capability of sources or obtaining information. It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services discussed in this notice. Any formal solicitation that may subsequently be issued will be announced separately through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate NOAA to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.
All information received will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Please do not submit any proprietary or classified information.
 
Purpose
 
The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about the capability and availability of purchasing up to two (2) high-altitude jet aircraft, with necessary modifications, to replace NOAA/AOC's Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft, providing reliability and redundancy in performing the critical missions currently executed on the G-IVSP.
 
Introduction
 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA. Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA's prioritized airborne requirements.
 
Background
 
The aircraft of the NOAA/AOC are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's environment. NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around the world over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic pack ice. These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data essential to their research.
The AOC owns, operates and maintains a Gulfstream G-IVSP (serial number 1246, tail designation N49RF), a highly modified twin-jet aircraft, primarily supporting two of NOAA's five Line Offices, the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) office. NWS works to provide weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enhancement of the national economy. OAR provides both the research foundation for understanding the complex systems that support our planet, and the unbiased science to better manage the environment, nationally and globally.  While the G-IVSP has the infrastructure to support a wide variety of instrumentation and mission capabilities, its primary data collection equipment is designed to measure vertical atmospheric profiles using dropwindsonde expendables, 3-dimensional wind fields in the presence of radar returns using the Tail Doppler Radar, and flight level in-situ state parameters (pressure, temperature, humidity and winds) with fuselage-mounted sensors.
Manufactured in 1994, the aircraft is exhibiting higher failure rates and reduced reliability, along with longer and more expensive maintenance cycles.  To avoid further loss of mission performance and reduction in availability, OMAO is seeking to replace this aircraft with a new platform that has no less than the NOAA G-IVSP's performance and capabilities.
When the NOAA G-IVSP was acquired there were gaps between its capabilities and the full set of NOAA science and operational mission requirements.  With the increased capabilities of the current generation of high-altitude business jets, there is the opportunity to better fulfill these mission requirements.  To that end, many of the specifications listed below consist of a minimum acceptable capability and a performance enhancement above or a desired capability in addition to that minimum.
This RFI is issued to gauge industry interest as well as aircraft availability for this requirement.
 
Aircraft Specifications

I.	Base Aircraft Description
 
The basic airframe (&lsquo;green aircraft') shall be a new multi-engine, transport category jet aircraft meeting the requirements of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 25 (14CFR25) and that meets or exceeds the Capabilities listed below.  The aircraft shall have a current and valid U.S. Airworthiness Certificate showing certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to 14CFR21. The aircraft shall be free of any significant damage history during manufacture and modification, and have all mandatory Airworthiness Directives, manufacturer's mandatory Service Bulletins and mandatory Aircraft Service Changes completed before delivery.  All installations / modifications are to be FAA certified to part 25 or the aircraft type certificate whichever is more stringent.  An approved FAA Form 337, or Supplemental Type Certificate, shall accompany all contractor-supplied modifications, to include supporting aeronautical documentation and engineering drawings and schematics.
II. Aircraft Capabilities
The aircraft shall have the following capabilities.  Note that some terminology is based on the current NOAA G-IV; similar characteristics presented in a different format are acceptable, as long as they can be related to the terms listed below:
A.	A service ceiling of at least 45,000 feet International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).  A higher service ceiling is desired.

The UPS subsystem shall have a separate manual deactivation switch accessible to the pilot.
f.	Specifics of mission power distribution will be included in the RFP if/when it is issued.
B.	Floor attachments for racks and seats - appropriate seat track or other fittings to allow attachment of mission equipment racks and seats in the cabin.  Desired to have flexibility in certified configurations and attach locations to allow for changing mission equipment requirements.  Wall and/or ceiling attach points may be included if rack weight and Center of Gravity (CG) desired limits necessitate additional attach points.
C.	Satellite Communication
a.	An Inmarsat-based system for voice and data.  Desired enhancement of a dual system for redundancy
i.	Two channels of voice communications, with one handset in the cockpit and at least one in the cabin.  Both channels of audio to be available as listen-only selections on the ICS system.  A desired enhancement is the ability to move location of cabin handset(s) to meet varying cabin configurations.
ii.	Data services with at least the speed provided by SwiftBroadband coupled with a High Gain Antenna, with Ethernet network connection.  Desired enhancement of a higher speed service with similar coverage area and a single provider service, such as Global Xpress.
b.	An Iridium-based system for voice and data
i.	At least one channel of voice communications, with handset in the cabin. Desired enhancements: Second channel with handset in the cockpit, all channels of audio to be available as listen-only selections on the ICS system, and the ability to move location of cabin handset to meet varying cabin configurations.
ii.	Data services of at least 4800 bps with Ethernet network connection.  Desired enhancement of a higher speed service, either through a multi-channel combiner or Iridium-Next.
iii.	Iridium based Sky Connect tracking system with automatic reporting of time stamped position, altitude, ground speed, and ground track information.
D.	Network Infrastructure - Runs of copper and fiber optic network cabling from rack and equipment locations to a patch panel, with provisions for network equipment (routers and/or switches) in the same location (network closet or similar); specifics of cable type, connectors and locations to be determined if/when an RFP is issued.
E.	Tail Doppler Radar (TDR)
a.	Tail-mounted radome to enclose antenna assembly for vertically scanning radar, similar to system installed on NOAA P-3 and G-IVSP.  Includes vertical mounting plate for antenna pedestal base.  The minimum radome size is sufficient to house current G-IVSP antenna assembly (current radome is approx. 44 inches interior diameter); radome to accommodate larger antenna assembly is desired, but may need to evaluate tradeoff with performance loss due to increased drag.
b.	Dual X-band (WR-112 or WR-90) waveguide runs from tail pedestal to pressurized cabin, including penetration of aft pressure bulkhead.  Wiring run (motor drive and position, specific wire types and quantities to be determined if/when an RFP is issued) from pedestal to pressurized cabin, including bulkhead connector at aft pressure bulkhead.
c.	Depending on aircraft layout and limitations, it may be desired to mount TDR electronics (approx. 45 inches of vertical 19 inch EIA/ECA-310 rack space) in an aft baggage compartment to minimize waveguide length and reduce cabin noise. If not mounted in the baggage compartment, additional waveguide runs to the equipment location in the main cabin will be required.
F.	Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS)The AVAPS consists of an expendable unit (the dropsonde), a launch chute assembly in the aircraft, antennas for telemetry (400 MHz VHF, mounted under the aircraft) and GPS (L1/L2 band, mounted on top of aircraft), and a receiver/processor system, which is rack mounted in the cabin.  More information about the AVAPS can be found at https://www.eol.ucar.edu/node/10082.
a.	A dropsonde launch chute is required, with location and design determined to allow for launch of expendables with adequate separation from the aircraft and without excessive g-loads or tumbling upon launch.  If the launch chute location is in the baggage compartment or other area with limited access, it is anticipated that the Government would provide an automated launcher similar to that used on the NCAR HIAPER aircraft, to be attached to the chute provided.  It is likely that the smaller &lsquo;mini' dropsonde (1.75 inches diameter, by approx. 12 inches long) would be used, rather than the larger dropsonde currently used on the NOAA G-IVSP.
b.	Installation of up-looking (GPS) and down-looking (VHF Telemetry) antennas, with coaxial cabling to a cabin location to be determined if/when an RFP is issued.  Antenna locations to be selected to maximize field of view and minimize coaxial cable distance to AVAPS rack-mounted receiver equipment.
V. Optional Provisions for Scientific Systems
The following items may be listed as either optional or required if a solicitation is issued:
A.	Cabin Seats - track-mounted, with fore-aft, lateral and vertical adjustments, FAA certified for takeoff and landing, with four- or five-point restraint systems.  Quantity to be determined by cabin layout and number of unique seat types (e.g. if seats are designed for left- or right-side only).
B.	Equipment Racks - single-bay, conforming to 19"" EIA/ECA-310 standards, minimum of 44"" vertical height (higher is desired), minimum of 386 lbs. weight capacity with CG 25"" above floor, decreasing to a minimum of 200 lbs. with equipment CG 47"" above the floor, higher weight and CG limits desired, but not at the expense of excessive rack frame weight.  Racks and rack limits are to be certified for FAA-required aircraft g-loads.  Quantity to be determined by cabin layout and number of unique rack types (e.g. if racks are designed for left- or right-side only).
C.	Wing Hard Points - Up to six wing stations (three on each side) with threaded holes and wiring to allow for mounting pylons and instrument pods.  Highly desired that the mounting provisions and capabilities be identical to the wing hard points on the NCAR HIAPER aircraft.  See the HIAPER Investigator's Handbook https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/nsfncar-hiaper-investigator-handbook, Chapter 5 for more information.
D.	Fuselage Mounting Provisions - Some combination of Aperture Pads and Plates (approx. 7""x10"" opening), Mounts (plates for attaching inlets, etc.), Pads (plates with 2"" diameter hole for sensors), Window Blanks, and Optical View Ports (20.5"" ports) is desired.  Specific types, quantities and locations are to be determined if/when an RFP is issued.  It is highly desired that each type conform to the form factor and load capabilities of the equivalent provision on NCAR HIAPER aircraft, although the quantity and specific locations may vary from the HIAPER configuration.  See the HIAPER Investigator's Handbook https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/nsfncar-hiaper-investigator-handbook, Chapter 5 for more information.
E.	Secondary launch chute - Provisions for a launch chute in the cabin area, consisting of a circular tube from the floor to the external skin, approximately 7"" internal diameter, angled similar to the chute on N49RF.  Initial delivery would be with a plug installed that was flat to the cabin floor and contoured to the external skin.  Provisions for installing a pressurized launch mechanism (e.g. circular flange at floor level with mounting holes) would be required, but the actual launch mechanism would not be included.
VI. Aircraft Availability
The desired time frame is delivery of the base (green) aircraft with Equipment and Required Provisions (as stated in Sections III and IV above) within 18 months of Contract award.  It is understood that Enhanced and Optional provisions may extend that time line.

USAF Airborne Sensors for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) (ASI) Request for Information (RFI)
Solicitation Number:  FA8620-16-R-4006
Agency : Department of the Air Force

Synopsis:  
 
FedBizOpps Request for information (RFI) FA8620-16-R-4006
 
USAF Airborne Sensors for Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR)(ASI) Study Supporting an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)
 
CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:  Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Special Operations Forces Directorate (AFLCMC/WI ), ISR Sensors and Foreign Military Sales Division (AFLCMC/WIN) Contracting Offices 2640 Loop Road West, Rm  215, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7106, United States.
 
SYNOPSIS:   An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is being conducted by the Air Force to investigate alternatives for materiel solutions to detect mobile targets and targets obscured by natural or man-made means. The AoA will explore tradespace in performance, schedule, risk and cost across a full range of options to address validated capability requirements.   Air Combat Command's ISR Requirements Division, ACC/A589/A51X , and AFLCMC/WI N have begun a one year Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) guided pre-Material Development Decision (MOD) effort developing the following AoA related products:
 
&bull;&middot;         Study Guide and Plan
&bull;&middot;         Concept Characterization and Technology Descriptions (CCTDs)
 
The focus is on airborne sensor modalities/phenomenologies including Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) which includes Electro/Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), Multispectral/Hyperspectral Imaging (MSl/HSI), Ground Surveillance Radar, Full Motion Video (FMV), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), and on-board processing/exploitation/fusion of sensor data.
 
PURPOSE:   In support of the USAF AoA for Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI), AFLCMC/WIN is requesting inputs and conducting market research to develop CCTDs from across industry, academia and government agency programs.  The AoA is being conducted to investigate alternatives for materiel solutions to detect mobile targets and targets obscured by natural or man-made means from medium and high altitudes.  This activity is required to develop acquisition documentation supporting the next steps in the JCIDS/DoDI 5000.02 acquisition process.  ASI is a follow-on to the ACC developed and the FY15 JROC approved Challenging Targets (CT) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  The AoA process is expected to contribute to the selection of a preferred materiel solution that satisfies the capability need documented in the approved ICD.  Following the pre-AoA and Air Force approval for a MDD, plans are to develop new Airborne Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) documents in FY17 for each of the sensor phenomenologists for both medium and high altitude.   Expectations are that this effort will significantly re-define both medium and high altitude ISR sensors requirements and shape Air Force efforts in the FY20-30 timeframe.  Additional background data supporting this RFI at the classified level can be obtained per instructions below.
 
CCTDs provide supporting evidence for candidate materiel solution approaches that have the potential to effectively address the capability gap(s), desired operational attributes, and associated dependencies.  The USAF AoA team will develop a CCTD as a repository for information that completely describes each alternative.  The CCTD serves as the starting point for system concept requirements developed in support of a milestone A decision.  The intent with this RFI is to ensure a thorough capture of current capabilities and to identify promising candidate programs/technology efforts with projected capabilities that may improve current and future Air Force ISR sensors and processing within the constraints identified in Ground Rules, Constraints and Assumptions (GRCA) identified below.
 
AFLCMC/WIN seeks white papers, data sheets, and quad charts by 1600 EST, 8 March 2016.   All correspondence submitted will be protected and controlled as proprietary.   After reviewing the submitted documents, the Government may request technical exchanges and/or site surveys of respondents' facilities.  Please note - the team highly encourages submission of data that may be well known and already documented by Air Force Program offices.  Additionally, the team is very interested in capturing and understanding on-going sensor/processing efforts managed by other services (Army, Navy, Marines) and agencies.  Please do not assume we already know about your program.   Although we encourage and prefer data according the template described below - we are willing to accept data sheets, brochures, briefings and papers in your format.
 
Per GRCA identified below, submitted white documents should identify current/potential candidate ASI AoA topics.  Industry/DoD/Academia topics may include ISR sensor programs/technologies/phenomenologists, associated on-board data processing/algorithms and components supporting end-to-end sensor functionality.  Candidate topics may include on-board processing (vice ground processing) for multiple airborne platforms, multi-INT sensor operations, sensor technologies to increase range, resolution and/or aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation/recognition tools, sensor networking capabilities).  In additional to complete systems, please consider sensor/processing components that may have potential to upgrade or improve current technologies.  Components do not need to be part of an existing sensor system; research and development of these components may be ongoing independent of a full system.
 
AoA GRCA:
&bull;&middot;         The focus will be on solutions to solving the capability gaps in table 1 (see classified background data), which is to find, fix and track mobile, concealed and obscured targets across all 6 phases of joint operational construct (Joint Publication 5-0).
&bull;&middot;         Focus is on medium and high airborne sensor modalities, to include Multi-INT approaches. Modalities include Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measures and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) to include Electro/Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), Spectral Multispectral/Hyperspectral Imaging (MSl/HSI), Ground Surveillance Radar, Full Motion Video (FMV), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), and on-board processing/exploitation/fusion of sensor data.
&bull;&middot;         30 Year lifecycle for sensors including pre-planned product improvements (P31)
&bull;&middot;         Will not assess the performance of platforms. For the purpose of Size, Cooling, Weight and Power (SCWAP), communications, and costing, the MQ-9, a business jet, and the RQ-4 and will be used as representative medium, medium to high, and high altitude platforms
&bull;&middot;         Assuming funding, alternatives should have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by 2020 in order to support a targeted Initial Operational Capability (IOC) by 2026 and Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2030
&bull;&middot;         Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Enterprise is the primary exploitation capability
&bull;&middot;         Non-proprietary approach: Open Mission Systems/Sensor Open System Architecture
&bull;&middot;         On-board data processing includes existing capabilities and plans to:
&bull;&middot;      Enhance on-board real-time processing for correlation/fusion of multi-source sensor data and object target recognition capabilities 
&bull;&middot;      Enhance and expand the range of application for fully automated target recognition (ATR) (all modalities)
&bull;&middot;         Alternatives will be a conventional CAF employed airborne ISR asset. The study will assess space capabilities as an enabler only, due to limitations of timeliness and persistence of space sensors.
 
Be advised: Review of submitted documentation will be accomplished by both United States Government (USG) employees and USG support contractors who have executed non-disclosure agreements.  USG support contractor input is advisory in nature only.
