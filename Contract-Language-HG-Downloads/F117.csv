The event will feature briefings highlighting the missions, capabilities, and core competencies of the Propulsion Maintenance Group (PMXG), Commodities Maintenance Group (CMXG), and Maintenance Support Group (MXSG). These presentations will focus on how OC-ALC can collaborate with industry partners to enhance and strengthen sustainment operations within the F117 engine program.

To encourage broad industry participation, the briefings will be held off-base. Additionally, attendees will have the option to participate in an on-base tour of a PMXG maintenance facility, offering a firsthand look at OC-ALC&rsquo;s expertise and operational capabilities.

Approximately 3&ndash;4 weeks after the in-person Industry Day, a follow-up virtual event will take place, featuring interactive breakout discussions for detailed engagement between government and industry representatives. This session will provide an opportunity for more in-depth dialogue, ensuring productive collaboration and knowledge exchange.

Date/Time: 25 June 2025, 9am-1pm (Time is tentative)
Briefing Location: TBD Off-Base Venue

This requirement is for a firm-fixed price contract for two (2) each NSN: 5340-01-303-3614BA, Bracket Angle, Mounting-Accelerometer, P/N 17G230052-1, which includes one First Article and one production asset, one First Article Test Plan, one First Article Test Report, and one IUID Marking Plan. This requirement also includes three annual options containing a quantity of 3 each. The C-17 aircraft is powered by four (4) Pratt &amp; Whitney F117-PW-100 high-bypass turbofan engines enclosed in isolated nacelles suspended below the wings. Part of the procedure for fault isolating the F11-PW-100 engine is to perform a vibration monitoring test while the engine, installed on the aircraft, is operated. Among the causes of excessive vibration is imbalance, bearing wear, and other types of mechanical deterioration. The vibration amplitude will be measured through the use of P/N 303-07C5 accelerometers mounted on the &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;P&rdquo; flanges of the engine. The &ldquo;B&rdquo; flange is located near the front of the engine, on the fan case. The &ldquo;P&rdquo; flange is located near the back of the engine, on the engine turbine exhaust case. Am means is required at the organizational- and depot-level of maintenance to mount the accelerometer at the 12 o&rsquo;clock position on the &ldquo;B&rdquo; engine flange. The means for the &ldquo;P&rdquo; flange will be documented separately. The mounting pad on the accelerometer has four (4) holes, 0.282&rdquo; diameter, in a square pattern, 1.88&rdquo; between adjacent holes. The hole spacing between bolts on the &ldquo;B&rdquo; flange is approximately 2.508&rdquo;. The holes on the flanges will accommodate 0.250&rdquo; diameter bolts. The means must be rigid enough to transmit the vibrations from the engine flange to the accelerometer without distorting the vibration signal. This will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. Offerors shall prepare their proposals in accordance with the mandatory, explicit, and detailed instructions contained in the RFQ. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal to be considered by the contracting agency. The Government will utilize the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), and other Government databases to determine contractor status before evaluating proposals. Proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria stated in the RFQ. All data for this weapon system is considered EXPORT CONTROLLED.

Requirement Information: Jet Engine Repair: Propulsion Strategic Maintenance, Overhaul and Repair (MRO) of whole engines, engine modules, and/or engine components typically in Federal Stock classes 2835 through 2995

This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of request for information being conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF). This research is being conducted as a strategic enterprise approach to product support for propulsion depot repair requirements. After information is received, the Air Force (AF) Propulsion Directorate (AFLCMC/LP) will consolidate data and rationale for a viable, auditable workload review in order to effectively manage an appropriate maintenance posture.

The Government will use the information gathered through publication of this SSS to review all AF-managed propulsion workloads from a strategic view considering policy, future supportability, etc., in order to assist AF leadership in making best value decisions that benefit both the AF and our industrial partners. The Workload Optimization process ensures that long-term source of repair (SOR) decisions for propulsion depot-level maintenance workloads are properly reviewed considering vital alternatives and evaluated against each other in order to assign priority strategically across the enterprise.

The Government is interested in all potential sources including Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 8(a) businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, etc.

Potential sources shall be capable of furnishing all labor, materials, facilities and equipment required to accomplish the repair, overhaul, and/or remanufacture.
