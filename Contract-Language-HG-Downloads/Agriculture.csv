188c086f7ef34af997b3ff1d2f06e0a8,W912DQSN3002,Notice of Intent: Sole Source USDA Former Grain Silo Storage Facility Groundwater Contamination Site,"This notice is for informational purposes only.

Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Kansas City District, intends to issue a contract action on a sole-source basis to Hydrogeologic Inc. (UEI: S7Q4GKNGGA81). This sole-source action will acquire Architect-Engineering (A-E) services from the Designer of Record (DOR) in support of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)/U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Former Grain Silo Storage Facility Groundwater Contamination Site, located in York, Nebraska.

Hydrogeologic (HGL) is the Designer of Record for the original design of the treatment facility at the contamination site. This contract will be used to revise the design of the pump system to bring it into compliance with and to incorporate any changes or requirements identified since the original design completion. Engineering During Construction (EDC) phase services will also be acquired under this contract.  The work performed under the intended contract action represents a continuation of the services originally provided by HGL, ensuring consistent application of the DOR&rsquo;s design intent and maintaining DOR responsibility throughout the construction phase.

Previously, HGL preformed the full design effort for the treatment facility at the CCC/USDA Former Grain Silo Storage Facility Groundwater Contamination Site under contract 2H-60011 for Argonne National Lab under Prime Contract Number DE-AC02-06CH11357. However, that contract has expired and cannot be extended. This follow-on contract is necessary to provide A-E services, including but not limited to:




	Providing design clarifications and modifications
	Conducting site visits and inspections
	Ensuring compliance with Biddability, Constructability, Operability, Environmental, and Sustainability (BCOES) standards
	EDC phase services
	Reviewing construction submittals and RFIs




Because HGL possesses extensive project-specific knowledge, experience, and expertise, awarding this contract to another firm would introduce significant risks, including:


	Increased costs due to revalidation of design and calculations
	Potential project delays while a new firm familiarizes itself with the existing design
	Loss of design continuity and technical inconsistencies
	As a result, HGL is the only firm capable of performing these services without unacceptable duplication of effort, cost, or delay.




This Notice of Intent is published in accordance with FAR 5.201. All responses received within 15 calendar days of this posting will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the Government&rsquo;s discretion.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals. Responses to this notice should be directed via email to Chris Lewis, at christopher.d.lewis3@usace.army.mil and Justin K. Bennett, at justin.k.bennett@usace.army.mil no later than 10:00 am (Central Time), on 14 March 2025

Vendor responses to the solicitation are due 03/02/2025 18:00 PST. Please access the 'Open Solicitations' tab in the VIPR Vendor application (https://apps.fs.usda.gov/vipr/vendor/) to start your response.

The Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Forest Service (USFS), National Zone requirement for Helicopter Operations Support Unit for Region 13 for use during Local, Regional, and nationwide fire suppression and all-hazard incidents was originally solicited under solicitation number 12024B24Q7002.

This amendment is to re-open this solicitation to conduct an open season Onboarding in accordance with Exhibit H - Special Contract Requirements of the original solicitation.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Onboarding is not a new procurement and operates differently than a new solicitation. Onboarding is a result of the provisions established in the original solicitation and is issued as a solicitation amendment to the original solicitation. The terms and conditions of the original solicitation require that 'The award decision under the open season solicitation is based upon the same evaluation factors/sub-factors as the original solicitation.' Additionally, the terms and conditions of the original solicitation require that, 'The terms and conditions of any resulting new IBPA awards are identical to the original awards and solicitation, to include period of performance.' Accordingly, while the Government will entertain suggestions and Industry input regarding the Onboarding amendment, the Government anticipates very little change to result from this input, especially as it regards any potential changes to the evaluation factors or resulting terms and conditions.

This amendment for Onboarding is against a Multiple Award Incident Blanket Purchase Agreement (IBPA) solicitation issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.

The open season Onboarding period will coincide with the USFS Contracting Officer (CO) IBPA Annual Review process, traditionally referred to as a 'Rollover' Modification process for existing IBPA awardees. Existing IBPA awardees will have the same opportunity to revise, modify rates, and add resources the same as potential new contractors do.

All proposed resources are subject to the original solicitation criteria. New Offerors that meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the original solicitation may submit a quote response through the VIPR system during open season. Award decisions from an open season solicitation response are based upon the same evaluation factors/sub-factors as the original solicitation. New quote responses must meet all Acceptability Pass/Fail Criteria of the original solicitation. The terms and conditions of any resulting new IBPA awards are identical to the original awards and solicitation, to include period of performance. Immediately after Onboarding and at the conclusion of the CO annual review/rollover modification period, any additional Contractors or accepted new resources to existing agreements are eligible to receive dispatches/BPA Calls with the same ordering procedures as listed within the agreements.",National Interagency Fire Center,2025-01-27 22:13:11.267000+00:00,2025-01-27,2025-03-03 02:00:00+00:00,2025-03-02,America/Los_Angeles,Solicitation,SBA,488190,Other Support Activities for Air Transportation,F003,Forest/Range Fire Suppression/Presuppression Services,,Cristina Heaney,cristina.heaney@usda.gov,4065993199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12C2,024B,USDA FOREST SERVICE,dc0ea0cec39c45e9acf790532e6ba929,cristina.heaney@usda.gov,cristina.heaney@usda.gov,2025-01-27 22:13:11.267000+00:00,2025-01-27 22:13:09.844000+00:00,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/12024B24Q7002-Solicitation-ba929,https://sam.gov/opp/226bb40d0fc6406c8d1201c19216b18c/view

5a80f56298c74beb9689bb53d495f822,DOIGFBO250003,D--Landsat Satellite Operations (LSO) RFI,"Amendment 1 - This announcement is amended to delete Attachment D - LMOC_Configuration_Item_Identification_List (CIIL)Amendment 2 - This announcement is amended to correct the submission date from 12/13 to 12/23 at 12:00pm eastern and post an updated Attachment D. United States Geological Survey (USGS)Request for Information (RFI) & Sources SoughtLandsat Satellite Operations (LSO)Landsat Satellite Operations (LSO) RFIThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research to identify potential sources and learn about industry capabilities, emerging technologies, and strategies to reduce cost and risk. This RFI does not constitute a request for quotes, proposals, or bids; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. Responses to this announcement are for planning purposes only. The results of the market research will contribute to the development of the requirement and guide acquisition decision-making.The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code to be used for this requirement is 541330 ¿ Engineering Services. Background/Mission OverviewLandsat satellites have continuously acquired multispectral images of the land surface since the launch of Landsat 1 in 1972. Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Five plus decades of these data provide a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research. Landsat images are also invaluable for emergency response and disaster relief. These data also support government, commercial, industrial, civilian, military, and educational communities throughout the United States (U.S.) and worldwide. Consistent with U.S. law and government policy stated in both the Commercial Space Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-303), and the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-555), the USGS partners with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in developing future Landsat capabilities. NASA develops the space segment (spacecraft and instruments) and provides the launch vehicle while the USGS develops the ground system and operates the mission after on-orbit commissioning. The Landsat Ground Segment currently supports mission operations for Landsat 8 and 9. The Landsat Ground Segment consists of the Ground System (GS) and its external interfaces including NASA institutional services. The GS includes the Landsat Multi-Satellite Operations Center (LMOC), the Ground Network (GN), and the Data Processing and Archive System (DPAS). External interfaces include NASA Near Space Network (NSN), Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Conjunction Assessment and Risk Analysis (CARA) and its Flight Dynamics Facility, the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center Data Archive, along with other external interfaces. The LMOC is located at NASA GSFC in Greenbelt, MD.  The primary functions of the LMOC include command and control, mission planning and scheduling, trending and analysis, flight dynamics, and physical/IT security for mission operations.  The LMOC plans and schedules all flight operation resources and constellation contact activities with a global network of ground stations. The LMOC monitors and controls each observatory including maneuver planning/execution and conjunction monitoring/avoidance activities and provides a full suite of attitude and orbit determination capabilities within flight dynamics. The LMOC performs a reconciliation of images collected against those entered into the archive and has the capability to review the table of on-board planned acquisitions. The LMOC will handle all science, calibration, and observatory activity planning, including through generation and verification of stored command loads for each observatory. Data exchanged with the LMOC includes telemetry, command and control, plans and schedules, trending and analysis summaries, logs, and additional associated interaction.In addition to the LMOC, there is a backup LMOC (bLMOC) which has the same functionality as the LMOC.  The bLMOC equipment is at the EROS Center near Sioux Falls, SD, and can be operated locally or from GSFC.  The LMOC and bLMOC are operated by a Flight Operations Team (FOT).  The FOT is responsible for Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 flight operations as well as the maintenance and sustainment of the LMOC and bLMOC equipment.  In addition, the FOT has spacecraft subsystem subject matter experts in the areas of attitude control, propulsion, electrical, thermal, flight software, command and data handling, Radio Frequency (RF) communications, and instruments (Operational Land Imager (OLI) 1 & 2 and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) 1 & 2).RFI Purpose and ObjectivesThe USGS is seeking information from companies who can responsively address the requirements for Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Satellite Operations described below and in the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW).  This RFI is intended to identify potential sources and collect information about current industry capabilities and performance. The Government is seeking approaches that demonstrate a safe, reliable, and cost-effective solution.  The scope of LSO includes:    * Overall project management for LSO;    * Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 flight systems operations and sustaining engineering;    * Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 real-time operations; and    * LMOC and bLMOC operations and sustaining engineering including subsystems software maintenance.

The first initiative involves supporting the Navy Expeditionary Combat Forces Europe/Africa Task Force SIX EIGHT (NECFEURAF-TF68) in enhancing their operational capabilities within the US European Command and US Africa Command areas of responsibility. The second initiative is focused on providing AutoCad, drafting, and 3-D printing support for the USDA Forest Service's National Technology and Development Program (NTDP). These initiatives aim to bolster operational efficiency and technological advancement within their respective domains.

For NECFEURAF-TF68, the contract seeks to acquire comprehensive operations, logistics, administrative, and exercise planning support. This includes providing expertise in fleet support, mine countermeasures, security measures such as Antiterrorism Force Protection (AT/FP), explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), expeditionary construction, diving and salvage operations, and expeditionary logistics. Personnel will be stationed at Camp Mitchell in Naval Station Rota, Spain. They will work closely with NECFEURAF-CTF68 department heads and task group personnel to ensure seamless information flow and coordination necessary for mission success.

In parallel, the USDA Forest Service's NTDP requires technical support services including AutoCad drafting and 3-D printing capabilities. The contractor will manage drawing archives, develop equipment drawings from various sources such as schematics or sketches, prepare mechanical illustrations using advanced computer-aided design tools like AutoCAD, and maintain a comprehensive drawing library. Additionally, they will serve as 3-D printing designers responsible for prototyping using additive manufacturing technologies. This effort supports NTDP’s projects across the Forest Service by ensuring precise technical documentation and innovative fabrication solutions.

Both contracts emphasize collaboration with government personnel while utilizing government-furnished resources where applicable.

The rational or circumstances for limiting competition.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Michigan State
Office Soil Specialists are tasked with analysis and maintenance of soil health throughout the state.
Because soil health cannot be accurately measured by only crop yield, water quality, or any other single
outcome, specialists must evaluate other indicators. Indicators are measurable properties of soil or plants that
provide clues about how well the soil can function. Measurable indicators such as physical, chemical, and
biological properties require the use of highly technical analysis equipment.
The GSSI products listed above are required to be compatible with our existing GSSI GPR system that include
RADAN 7 software, 200 MHz antennae, 400 MHz antennae, and 900 MHz antennae. The existing system has
been in operation since August 2019, the software and antennas are not compatible with competitors&rsquo; systems
and NRCS staff have received specialized training to specifically operate the existing GSSI GPR system. .
Similar devices do exist; however, only product provided by GSSI are compatible with the existing system.
GSSI informed the USDA that GSSI does not use authorized resellers and that the all equipment is proprietary

The USFS Fire and Aviation Management (F&AM) National and Regional Program Office Representatives will determine annually whether it is in the Government's best interest to initiate an open season on-ramping process to add additional Contractors and/or resources during the annual Contracting Officer (CO) review period noted in Section C.3.1 of the solicitation. 

Section D.2 within the solicitation will contain equipment & personnel requirement details. The Contractor is responsible for all equipment, materials, supplies, transportation, lodging, managed/supervised/trained/certified personnel necessary to meet or exceed the Agreement specifications. The resources may be used in the protection of lands, to include but not be limited to, severity, fire suppression, all-hazard incidents, and RX prescribed project work. Optional awarded agreement use by Interagency Cooperators (DOI, NPS, BIA, State etc..) are subject to that agency?s payment and administrative terms.

RATES: Proposed rates should be based on up to a 16hr. Daily Shift and include all within B.2 -- PRICING AND ESTIMATED QUANTITY. 

Note: D.21.8.1 -- Rates of Payments. Payment will be at the rates specified in the agreement that is in effect at the time of the order. 

DISPATCH CENTER: Agreements will be competitively awarded within the advertised and available regional dispatch centers. Agreement intent and Government guidance is for Quoters to select the available dispatch center closest to their resource location to reasonably meet the Government's (Host Agency's) date and time needed for emergency incident support, as well as offer best value to the Government for travel costs for each potential dispatch/BPA Call. Since wildland fire support and locations are unknown at time of award, selection of a host dispatch center/zone outside of where the resources reside may result in loss of opportunity and failure to meet Government's critical and timely need at time of incident.

This initiative is spearheaded by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) Facility Project Management Office (FPMO). The contract aims to provide comprehensive program management support services that are crucial for the successful design and construction of a new Currency Production Facility (CPF) at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

The contractor will be responsible for supplying all necessary personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, and supervision required to perform a wide range of program support activities. These activities are essential for ensuring that the project meets its objectives efficiently and effectively. The contract explicitly states that service providers will operate independently without direct supervision from government staff but will remain accountable to their contractor entity.

The background context for this solicitation highlights BEP's critical role in designing and manufacturing U.S. currency across two existing facilities: the District Currency Facility in Washington D.C. and the Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The FPMO's mission includes federal oversight over design and construction efforts associated with developing the new CPF. This encompasses pre-planning stages through to commissioning while collaborating with partners like the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Capital Currency Team (CCT), and future general contractors.",Federal Acquisition Service,2023-12-12 00:00:00+00:00,2023-12-12,2024-01-03 17:00:00+00:00,2024-01-03,,Sources Sought,SBA,541330,Engineering Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEDERAL ACQUISITION SERVICE,,Boston,MA,02222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0624171b22755fa99e19c20944638d96-re,,,,,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/r-RFQ1670142-re,https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/seller/prepare-quote/RFQ1670142?contractNumber=
31611f50228f4aedbed897facee0741d,70RSAT24RFI000003,NBACC Expansion Pre-Conceptual Design,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was mandated to provide the Federal Government&rsquo;s response to terrorist attacks and major disasters, through The Homeland Security Act of 2002. As an element of that, the DHS identified the need for the National Biodefense Analysis &amp; Countermeasures Centers (NBACC) program, to establish modern secure biocontainment facilities and provide technologies, products, and capabilities to support the DHS in fulfilling responsibilities in respect to terrorist attacks and major disasters involving human and agricultural biological threat agents (BTA). NBACC is a one-of-a-kind facility dedicated to defending the nation against biological threats.  The NBACC facility is located on the National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC) at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

Growing demands for research and forensics have pushed the capabilities of the facility to its limits and expansion is necessary to ensure that it can fulfill its mission. The expansion of the threat landscape requires additional infrastructure within NBACC to maintain relevant threat characterization capabilities to address the risks the advancing biotechnology landscape poses to the Nation. The landscape of the biological threats is continually evolving, and efforts to keep pace with them require ongoing adaption and investment. S&amp;T ONL anticipates that the NBACC expansion will be connected and adjacent to the existing NBACC structure at Fort Detrick, Maryland. S&amp;T ONL estimates that the expansion will include approximately 40,000 square feet of Biological Safety Level 3 space, 10,000 square feet of administrative space, and 5,000 square feet of Sensitive Compartment Information Facility (SCIF) space.

The objective of the NBACC Expansion Pre-Conceptual Design is to provide information on conceptual layouts that will enable the NBACC program to perform an alternatives analysis. This progression requires that the project team better understand the size, features, and location of the building (relative to the existing facility) as well as the schedule and budget to complete the project through turnover to operations. S&amp;T ONL is seeking information on qualified entities that can support the following types of activities in support of an expansion of the NBACC:


	Conduct workshops and design charettes with key stakeholders to determine user needs. 
	Document the requirements for the NBACC expansion, including information about workflows inside of the facility and individual laboratory spaces.
	Develop one or more conceptual layouts to the new building(s) that addresses the requirements and fits the physical and other site constraints.
	Develop a schedule and cost estimate for the detailed design, construction, commissioning, and start-up.


The estimated period of performance for the pre-conceptual design is 6 months.

The more relevant and recent examples demonstrating experience in the four primary services as identified above, the higher the offeror shall be rated.  The larger the number of examples which are of work by prime and prime key personnel, the higher the rating.

The more diverse design and engineering experience in various types of geographic conditions (upland, marsh, watersheds, mountainous, etc.) and the higher degree of complexity of the projects, the higher the offeror shall be rated.

B.    Professional Qualifications:
Firm must possess professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services similar in nature to those required as part of this requirement.  Information shall be provided to demonstrate key personnel and other disciplines required for contract performance including professional registrations, advanced degrees and recognized designations of industry professional organizations.

The Offeror shall provide resumes for all key personnel identified for the proposed team.  Resumes shall indicate all relevant experience, professional qualifications, training, education, past performance, team experience and expected availability of each individual listed as key personnel.  Resumes shall not exceed AM#01 TWO (2) 8 &frac12;&quot; x 11&quot; pages for each individual.  

Evaluation will be based on review of Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The more relevant the demonstrated experience, professional qualifications, training and education; and years of experience, the more qualified the individual shall be considered for the position proposed.  The more qualified the Offeror&#39;s proposed individuals, the higher the Offeror shall be rated.
Offerors must have a minimum of one (1) professional engineer and one (1) professional land surveyor licensed in each state of Region 1.AM#02 A copy of the license must be included in the SF330 submission. The license(s) will not count toward the AM#04 200 Page Limit.

Higher ratings will be assigned to those offerors with more than one licensed professional engineer and professional land surveyor in each state of Region 1; those with more than 10 years experience; and demonstrated experience performing geotechnical, hydrology and hydraulic modeling, dam assessment and dam rehabilitation experience within Region 1.

C.    Past Performance:
Offerors must be able to demonstrate successful past performance on a range of projects - variety of scope, scale and complexity. Past performance can be submitted for the prime or subcontractors.  The Offeror&#39;s role on the projects submitted must be identified. Successful performance can be established and substantiated from the point of view of the client, professional peers, and/or project teammates.  Demonstrated success at collaborative relationships with consultants will be positively considered.  The Government has the right to use institutional knowledge when evaluating this factor. 

Past performance will be judged and considered relevant based on the satisfactory completion of current and past contracts of a similar nature to contracts contemplated under this action including scope, complexity, and dollar value.  Satisfactory past performance shall be verified by reference checks initiated through the example projects submitted under the Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluation factor A, and may also be established through information available in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), through the Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) provided by applicable clients upon request by Offeror, through self-provided performance recognition documentation, or through institutional knowledge.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted as attachments to the SF330 and shall include either the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see attachment), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluations, or self-provided performance recognition.  Offerors are required to submit past performance on at least three (3) projects, but not more than 5 projects; at least three of which must for those submitted as part of Criterion A and listed in the SF330, Part I, Section F. 
Past performance is relevant information regarding an offeror&#39;s actions under previously awarded contracts.  It includes the Offeror&#39;s overall quality of and record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, adherence to scope, schedule and budget, including the administrative aspects of performance; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, including the offeror&#39;s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.
While offerors are required to submit a minimum of 3 references, but not more than 5, the government is not required to conduct or complete reference checks on more than 3 contracts.  If more than 3 references are provided, the government reserves the right to choose which references to include in its evaluation. 

In addition to those references provided directly by the Offeror, the government may identify and analyze the past performance of the Offeror on any other relevant contract of which the Contracting Officer obtains knowledge, including but not limited to projects listed in CPARS.  Because of the wide variety of past performance history of individual Offerors, the Government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained for each Offeror.

In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, failure of the Offeror to provide a minimum of three relevant references that meet the criteria listed above, and/or the inability of the Government to complete a minimum of three reference checks, after making a reasonable effort to do so, will result in the Offeror being rated as &quot;neutral&quot; on the past performance factor.

Evaluation will be based on overall past performance on contracts for similar services as judged by references who are contacted, and the references indicate that they would hire the offeror again for the same or similar services.  Documentation provided or available for review establishes satisfactory past performance on similar, relevant contracts.

The more similar the services and the better the evaluation/evaluation comments, the higher the rating.

D.    Capacity to Accomplish the Work:
This factor evaluates whether an offeror has sufficient technical resources in the various technical disciplines to accomplish the work and whether there are appropriate quality control procedures and tools available to ensure quality products and timely delivery.  

Submittal requirements for this factor include providing an organizational chart of key personnel as an attachment and indicated in Part I, Section D and Part II Architect-Engineer Qualifications-General for each firm. AM#01 Organizational Chart may be 11x17.
In addition, examples of specific project management should be submitted for no more than 3 relevant past performance projects and attached under Part I, Section H.  Each Plan submitted may also include a one-page summary outlining areas where the Plan effectively fostered goals for good project management, including schedule management, responsiveness, resource management, reporting methods, etc.

Evaluation will be based on the offeror demonstrating adequate staffing resources and the capability to perform and balance multiple task orders concurrently and to balance competing needs of multiple customers.  Submitted material should outline methods and processes the firm/team shall use to track and report project status to multiple CORs, maintain schedules and ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis.

E.     Knowledge of the Locality:
Offerors must demonstrate knowledge of the locality and the general geographic area Region 1 to successfully perform.
Submittal requirements involve fully completing Part 1, Section C to include complete addresses of proposed team, and review of Part 1, Section F Example Projects.  There are no specific additional submittal requirements for this factor.
Evaluation will be based on the location of offices and example projects within Region 1.  Offerors with one or more offices within the geographic area and/or with example projects within the geographic area with of Region 1 will receive a higher rating.

F.     Geographic Proximity 
Criteria F is secondary criteria and will only be used as a &ldquo;tie-breaker&rdquo; among firms which are rated as technically equal after the interview phase of the selection process.  In the event of a tie, the firm with the most offices within the geographic area will break the tie.

EVALUATON FACTORS FOR AWARD

This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection. The most important factor is price. The technical evaluation factors which consist of the Sample Work Product, Past Performance Experience, and Key Personnel Experience are of equal importance. All technical evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly less important than cost or price. The lowest priced proposal will first be evaluated for technical acceptability. If determined not technically acceptable, it will be removed from competition and the next lowest priced proposal will be evaluated for technical acceptability. This will continue until the lowest priced proposal that is determined to be technically acceptable has been identified. Once the lowest priced proposal that is determined to be technically acceptable has been identified the evaluations will be closed, and award will be made.

Proposals will be evaluated for merit and the ability to satisfy the objectives of the acquisition based on the evaluation criteria, factors, and sub-factors listed herein. The Government will award the contract to the responsive, responsible offeror whose proposal provides the lowest price based upon meeting a Go/No-Go on technical acceptability evaluation criteria as follows:

Factor 1 - Price

Factor 2 - Sample Work Product
Provide a sample report of a roof assessment performed on a project of similar size, age, scope, function, and complexity to the subject project that shows a clear understanding of the specific work requested and demonstrates how the report provided an effective solution to the agency's needs. Specific information that identifies the project location, client, proprietary information or contains Personally Identifying Information (PII) must be redacted to be considered acceptable.

Factor 3 Past Performance Experience
Experience: for work in which you have been a prime contractor, provide a list of at least three (3) projects within the last five (5) years of similar size, scope, function, and complexity to the subject project. Government/Education/Research Facility experience is preferred but not required. Provide the information specified below for each project listed.

1.	Title and brief description of contract
2.	Location
3.	Owner/Client
4.	Contract period of performance
5.	Name and Phone # of Contracting Officer/Owners Representative

Factor 4 -- Key Personnel Experience
Provide resumes for key personnel that will be performing the roof assessment. The resumes must clearly show required OSHA Training; experience in assessing sloped roof installations; and experience in performing thermal imaging surveys.

For each key personnel provide the following information as a minimum:
1.	Number of years with the company (must have at least 3 years' experience)
2.	Number of years' experience (must have at least 5 years' experience)
3.	Role on the project.
4.	Work performed on prior similar projects (must have at least 3 past projects)

GREENWOOD MS 38930, as they are the sole source for these services pursuant to the authority of FAR clause 16.505 (b)(2)(C) which states... The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract.

The award will be to purchase the following product/services:

The ARS/ DALE BUMPERS NATIONAL RICE RESEARCH CENTER, STUTTGART, ARKANSAS requires a DESIGN NEW HVAC SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED UPGRADES TO B001 AND B001A.

This action will be issued as a firm fixed price purchase order/ contract issued to A&amp;E firm Johnson McAdams for direct continuation of the current and past design efforts of the new HVAC system for DBNRRC. The research unit is requesting a sole source procurement on this basis.

Johnson McAdams has already designed Phase 1a, 2a and 3a in addition to the preliminary design requirements and cost estimates for Phase 2 and Phase 3. 

Considering these circumstances, it is my belief, as the contracting officer that the best course of action is to pursue a sole source procurement under Authority FAR clause 16.505 (b)(2)(C) which states...

The award will be to purchase the following product/services:
The USDA ARS, Athens, GA requires New ADA compliant door hardware, cores, and keys for all hallway doors in building 1.

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: 
This project will involve installation of new cores, ADA compliant hardware as needed, and keys on 402 doors in building 1 at the USNPRC. All items listed must use the Mul-T-Lock 600 key system and Mul-T-Lock 236B KIK cores so that it will match the current system we have in other parts of the campus/buildings. Jerrys Lock and Key in Athens GA is the only dealer in our area authorized to sell this system, so we are requesting a sole source requirement to ensure that the keys systems will match what we currently have and can have a local company for rapid support in an emergency since these are high security keys that can only be made by them. The job will include a total of 402 doors. 289 of those doors will require new ADA compliant hardware, new cores, keys, and labor for installation.  113 doors will require new cores, keys, and labor for installation. 


All items listed must use the Mul-T-Lock 600 key system and Mul-T-Lock 236B KIK cores so that it will match the current system we have in other parts of the campus/buildings. Jerry&rsquo;s Lock and Key in Athens GA is the only dealer in our area authorized to sell this system. We are requesting a sole source award for the following reasons. 
1.    We currently use the Mul-T-Lock key system and Mul-T-Lock KIK cores in other parts of our building. If we changed key systems, this would require us to rekey over 400 other doors currently on the Mul-t-lock system at an additional cost., which is not cost effective to government.
2.    Mul-T-Lock only issues the high security key fingerprint used to make our keys to one dealer. That fingerprint key is currently issued to Jerry&rsquo;s Lock and Key. If it was awarded to a different dealer, they would have to issue a different fingerprint and the key systems wouldn&rsquo;t be compatible with our current doors. So, we would be forced to carry multiple keys for the different systems.

This is a Sources Sought notice Only.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  This Sources Sought is issued for information and planning purposes only as part of USDA ARS market research and does not itself constitute an RFQ.



 Background: The USDA ARS National Cold-Water Marine Aquaculture Center&rsquo;s Shellfish Genetics Lab (Kingston, RI) is currently developing an eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, breeding program for the Northeast area.  This program will be a family-based breeding program that utilizes the deployment of tens of thousands of oyster seed from various family crosses to a multitude of local oyster growers in the Northeast area.

Once the oyster seed is created in our oyster hatchery and is large enough to be deployed to the oyster farms, each oyster will be individually tagged with a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag, a type of radio frequency identification device (RFID), so their growth and survival can be monitored. 

Our lab currently uses Biomark PIT tags, and Biomark PIT Tag readers and we are requesting 2 more PIT tag readers and 30,000 PIT tags to increase the throughout of this project.



Specifications:

Title: Pit Tags and Pit Tag Reader



Technical requirements: 

PIT tags:


	PIT tags (min and max size requirements) are 9mm Length x 2.12mm Diameter. &ndash; this is because they need to fit on a specific size of oyster seed.
	Biocompatible glass encapsulation &ndash; proven to be compatible with the epoxy system we use to attach to the oysters.
	Must be compatible with Biomark HDR Lite PIT tag readers.




PIT Tag reader:


	Compatible with Biomark HPT9 PT tags

	Drop resistant and waterproof housing &ndash; will be used in the field in wet and muddy environments.
	Memory for storage of over 50,000 tag IDs, each with a corresponding date/time stamp &ndash; We will be reading out thousands of oysters in a day/week and will need to store a lot of data before downloading it.  We will need the date and time stamp for future reference.
	Internal 7.2V lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack - needed for field work and compatibility with our field battery pack Jackery power supplies.  This is in case the reader&rsquo;s battery dies in the field it can be hooked up to our Jackery power supply to charge while in the field.
	Backlit LCD high-contrast easy to view screen &ndash; This is in case we are working at dawn or dusk so we can see the screen.
	Visual, audible, and vibrating indication of a tag detection &ndash; This is needed to know the tag has been read successfully and that the operator can move on to the next sample.
	Bluetooth wireless communication &ndash; Needed for ease of data retrieval.

    (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ""late"" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and 
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

  (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.

This requirement is for commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101 and will be prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.  This notice of intent is not a competitive solicitation or request for quotes. No solicitation package is available.



The U. S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS), intends to award a contract to Vigil America (Vigil) for II+c Military 2-pin AAD in automatic activation devices (AAD).  The USFS has found Vigil to be the only reasonably available source to successfully supply the required AADs for smokejumper operations.  The resulting contract will be for a 12-month base period and include four (4) additional 12-month option periods; to be exercised at the USFS&rsquo; discretion.  Since the USFS&rsquo; initial market research indicates that only one responsible source can provide the AADs that will satisfy the Agency&#39;s requirements, a sole source justification is being prepared.  The USFS anticipates award before 1 May 2023 with services to begin no later than 1 June 2023.



The Vigil II+c Military 2-pin AAD devices are proprietary to Vigil and there are no other authorized contractors approved to provide this USFS mandated piece of safety equipment. Furthermore, the Vigil AAD is the only waterproof AAD safety device authorized for use that has passed the stringent, controlled evaluation process for safety, strength, and deployment conducted by the Bureau of Land Management and adopted by the USFS following the results of said evaluations. Going outside of the USFS-approved equipment list could result in equipment damage, system failure, and extreme bodily injury and/or death to smokejumper operators. The only AAD with waterproof capability known to possess the required specifications (proven through extensive testing and evaluation) and meeting the needs of the smokejumper mission and safety needs is the Vigil II+c Military 2-pin AAD.



Contractors that have questions regarding the sole source nature of this requirement or contractors who believe they can provide the required AADs are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the USFS.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Responses to this notice can be emailed to Gwendolynn.Boyle@usda.gov.



All responses must include the contractor&#39;s Unique Entity ID (UEI) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Contractors must additionally identify themselves as either a small business or other than small business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  The applicable small business size standard is 1,250 employees.  The Product Service Code is 4240 &ndash; Safety and Rescue Equipment.



A determination by the USFS not to compete this proposed action, based on the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the USFS.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.



Any contractor interested in conducting business with the Federal Government must be registered and active in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) prior to submitting a response.  SAM.gov is a FREE, Federal Government-owned and operated website at https://sam.gov/content/home. By submitting a response, the contractor is self-certifying that neither the principal corporate official(s) nor owner(s) is currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the response.  By submission of a response, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the SAM.gov database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any resulting contract.

&bull;    Specialized Experience and Technical Competence 
&bull;    Professional Qualifications 
&bull;    Past Performance 
&bull;    Capacity to Accomplish the Work 
&bull;    Knowledge of the Locality 

A.    Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:

Offeror must demonstrate success in appropriately addressing complex engineering services utilizing multi-disciplinary teams.  Offeror must be able to provide services ranging from pre-design plans and studies through construction management.  Highlight areas of expertise in dam assessments, watershed rehabilitation planning, watershed planning, engineering design service and other additional services as identified above.  Examples must include evidence to demonstrate the degree of complexity of work performed.  The prime firm&#39;s experience will be weighted more heavily than subcontractor&#39;s experience.  Similar projects with a higher degree of complexity will be weighted more heavily those than with a lower degree of complexity.  

Submittal requirements for this factor must be submitted under Part I, Section F, Example Projects of the SF330 form.  Submit at least one project demonstrating expertise in each of the four primary service areas: dam assessment, watershed rehabilitation planning, watershed planning, and engineering design.  No more than two projects per service area.  For each example project / contract listed in the completed SF330, the offeror may submit no more than two (2) 8 &frac12;&quot; x 11&quot; pages containing narrative and/or graphic material.

Evaluation will be based on demonstration of the ability to provide a wide array of engineering and design services by the prime firm and any subcontractors or partners and their key personnel necessary to accomplish the requirements as outlined.

The more relevant and recent examples demonstrating experience in the four primary services as identified above, the higher the offeror shall be rated.  The larger the number of examples which are of work by prime and prime key personnel, the higher the rating.

The more diverse design and engineering experience in various types of geographic conditions (upland, marsh, watersheds, mountainous, etc.) and the higher degree of complexity of the projects, the higher the offeror shall be rated.

B.    Professional Qualifications:

Firm must possess professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services similar in nature to those required as part of this requirement.  Information shall be provided to demonstrate key personnel and other disciplines required for contract performance including professional registrations, advanced degrees and recognized designations of industry professional organizations.  Evaluation will be based upon the number of personnel; their knowledge and level of experience associated with the types of work required.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted under Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The Offeror shall provide resumes for all key personnel identified for the proposed team.  Resumes shall indicate all relevant experience, professional qualifications, training, education, past performance, team experience and expected availability of each individual listed as key personnel.  Resumes shall not exceed  AM#01 TWO (2) 8 &frac12;&quot; x 11&quot; pages for each individual.  

Evaluation will be based on review of Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The more relevant the demonstrated experience, professional qualifications, training and education; and years of experience, the more qualified the individual shall be considered for the position proposed.  The more qualified the Offeror&#39;s proposed individuals, the higher the Offeror shall be rated.

Offerors must have a minimum of one (1) professional engineer and one (1) professional land surveyor licensed in each state of Region 11. AM#02 A copy of the license must be included in the SF330 submission. The license(s) will not count toward the AM#04 200 page limit.

Higher ratings will be assigned to those offerors with more than one licensed professional engineer and professional land surveyor in each state of Region 11; those with more than 10 years experience; and demonstrated experience performing geotechnical, hydrology and hydraulic modeling, dam assessment and dam rehabilitation experience within Region 11.

C.    Past Performance:

Offerors must be able to demonstrate successful past performance on a range of projects - variety of scope, scale and complexity.  Past performance can be submitted for the prime or subcontractors.  The Offeror&#39;s role on the projects submitted must be identified.  Successful performance can be established and substantiated from the point of view of the client, professional peers, and/or project teammates.  Demonstrated success at collaborative relationships with consultants will be positively considered.  The Government has the right to use institutional knowledge when evaluating this factor. 

Past performance will be judged and considered relevant based on the satisfactory completion of current and past contracts of a similar nature to contracts contemplated under this action including scope, complexity, and dollar value.  Satisfactory past performance shall be verified by reference checks initiated through the example projects submitted under the Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluation factor A, and may also be established through information available in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), through the Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) provided by applicable clients upon request by Offeror, through self-provided performance recognition documentation, or through institutional knowledge.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted as attachments to the SF330 and shall include either the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see attached), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluations, or self-provided performance recognition.  Offerors are required to submit past performance on at least three (3) projects, but not more than 5 projects; at least three of which must for those submitted as part of Criterion A and listed in the SF330, Part I, Section F. 

Past performance is relevant information regarding an offeror&#39;s actions under previously awarded contracts.  It includes the Offeror&#39;s overall quality of and record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, adherence to scope, schedule and budget, including the administrative aspects of performance; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, including the offeror&#39;s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

While offerors are required to submit a minimum of 3 references, but not more than 5, the government is not required to conduct or complete reference checks on more than 3 contracts.  If more than 3 references are provided, the government reserves the right to choose which references to include in its evaluation. 

In addition to those references provided directly by the Offeror, the government may identify and analyze the past performance of the Offeror on any other relevant contract of which the Contracting Officer obtains knowledge, including but not limited to projects listed in CPARS.  Because of the wide variety of past performance history of individual Offerors, the Government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained for each Offeror.

In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, failure of the Offeror to provide a minimum of three relevant references that meet the criteria listed above, and/or the inability of the Government to complete a minimum of three reference checks, after making a reasonable effort to do so, will result in the Offeror being rated as &quot;neutral&quot; on the past performance factor.

Evaluation will be based on overall past performance on contracts for similar services as judged by references who are contacted, and the references indicate that they would hire the offeror again for the same or similar services.  Documentation provided or available for review establishes satisfactory past performance on similar, relevant contracts.

The more similar the services and the better the evaluation/evaluation comments, the higher the rating.

D.    Capacity to Accomplish the Work:

This factor evaluates whether an offeror has sufficient technical resources in the various technical disciplines to accomplish the work and whether there are appropriate quality control procedures and tools available to ensure quality products and timely delivery.  

Submittal requirements for this factor include providing an organizational chart of key personnel as an attachment and indicated in Part I, Section D and Part II Architect-Engineer Qualifications-General for each firm. AM#01 Organizational Chart may be submitted in 11x17. AM#01
In addition, examples of specific project management should be submitted for no more than 3 relevant past performance projects and attached under Part I, Section H.  Each Plan submitted may also include a one-page summary outlining areas where the Plan effectively fostered goals for good project management, including schedule management, responsiveness, resource management, reporting methods, etc.

Evaluation will be based on the offeror demonstrating adequate staffing resources and the capability to perform and balance multiple task orders concurrently and to balance competing needs of multiple customers.  Submitted material should outline methods and processes the firm/team shall use to track and report project status to multiple CORs, maintain schedules and ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis.

E.    Knowledge of the Locality:

Offerors must demonstrate knowledge of the locality and the general geographic area Region 11 to successfully perform.

Submittal requirements involve fully completing Part 1, Section C to include complete addresses of proposed team, and review of Part 1, Section F Example Projects.  There are no specific additional submittal requirements for this factor.

Evaluation will be based on the location of offices and example projects within Region 11.  Offerors with one or more offices within the geographic area and/or with example projects within the geographic area with of Region 11 will receive a higher rating.

F.    Geographic Proximity: 

Criteria F is secondary criteria and will only be used as a &ldquo;tie-breaker&rdquo; among firms which are rated as technically equal after the interview phase of the selection process.  In the event of a tie, the firm with the most offices within the geographic area will break the tie.

Resumes shall not exceed AM#01 TWO (2) 8 &frac12;&quot; x 11&quot; page for each individual.  

Evaluation will be based on review of Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The more relevant the demonstrated experience, professional qualifications, training and education; and years of experience, the more qualified the individual shall be considered for the position proposed.  The more qualified the Offeror&#39;s proposed individuals, the higher the Offeror shall be rated.

Offerors must have a minimum of one (1) professional engineer and one (1) professional land surveyor licensed in each state of Region 10. AM#02 Copy of the license must be included in the SF330 submission. The license(s) will not count toward the AM#04 200 page limit.

Higher ratings will be assigned to those offerors with more than one licensed professional engineer and professional land surveyor in each state of Region 10; those with more than 10 years experience; and demonstrated experience performing geotechnical, hydrology and hydraulic modeling, dam assessment and dam rehabilitation experience within Region 10.

C.    Past Performance:

Offerors must be able to demonstrate successful past performance on a range of projects - variety of scope, scale and complexity.  Past performance can be submitted for the prime or subcontractors.  The Offeror&#39;s role on the projects submitted must be identified.  Successful performance can be established and substantiated from the point of view of the client, professional peers, and/or project teammates.  Demonstrated success at collaborative relationships with consultants will be positively considered.  The Government has the right to use institutional knowledge when evaluating this factor. 

Past performance will be judged and considered relevant based on the satisfactory completion of current and past contracts of a similar nature to contracts contemplated under this action including scope, complexity, and dollar value.  Satisfactory past performance shall be verified by reference checks initiated through the example projects submitted under the Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluation factor A, and may also be established through information available in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), through the Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) provided by applicable clients upon request by Offeror, through self-provided performance recognition documentation, or through institutional knowledge.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted as attachments to the SF330 and shall include either the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see attached), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluations, or self-provided performance recognition.  Offerors are required to submit past performance on at least three (3) projects, but not more than 5 projects; at least three of which must for those submitted as part of Criterion A and listed in the SF330, Part I, Section F. 

Past performance is relevant information regarding an offeror&#39;s actions under previously awarded contracts.  It includes the Offeror&#39;s overall quality of and record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, adherence to scope, schedule and budget, including the administrative aspects of performance; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, including the offeror&#39;s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

While offerors are required to submit a minimum of 3 references, but not more than 5, the government is not required to conduct or complete reference checks on more than 3 contracts.  If more than 3 references are provided, the government reserves the right to choose which references to include in its evaluation. 

In addition to those references provided directly by the Offeror, the government may identify and analyze the past performance of the Offeror on any other relevant contract of which the Contracting Officer obtains knowledge, including but not limited to projects listed in CPARS.  Because of the wide variety of past performance history of individual Offerors, the Government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained for each Offeror.

In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, failure of the Offeror to provide a minimum of three relevant references that meet the criteria listed above, and/or the inability of the Government to complete a minimum of three reference checks, after making a reasonable effort to do so, will result in the Offeror being rated as &quot;neutral&quot; on the past performance factor.

Evaluation will be based on overall past performance on contracts for similar services as judged by references who are contacted, and the references indicate that they would hire the offeror again for the same or similar services.  Documentation provided or available for review establishes satisfactory past performance on similar, relevant contracts.

The more similar the services and the better the evaluation/evaluation comments, the higher the rating.

D.    Capacity to Accomplish the Work:

Evaluation will be based on demonstration of the ability to provide a wide array of engineering and design services by the prime firm and any subcontractors or partners and their key personnel necessary to accomplish the requirements as outlined.

The more relevant and recent examples demonstrating experience in the four primary services as identified above, the higher the offeror shall be rated.  The larger the number of examples which are of work by prime and prime key personnel, the higher the rating.

The more diverse design and engineering experience in various types of geographic conditions (upland, marsh, watersheds, mountainous, etc.) and the higher degree of complexity of the projects, the higher the offeror shall be rated.

B.    Professional Qualifications:

Firm must possess professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services similar in nature to those required as part of this requirement.  Information shall be provided to demonstrate key personnel and other disciplines required for contract performance including professional registrations, advanced degrees and recognized designations of industry professional organizations.  Evaluation will be based upon the number of personnel; their knowledge and level of experience associated with the types of work required.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted under Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The Offeror shall provide resumes for all key personnel identified for the proposed team.  Resumes shall indicate all relevant experience, professional qualifications, training, education, past performance, team experience and expected availability of each individual listed as key personnel.  Resumes shall not exceed AM#01 TWO (2) 8 &frac12;&quot; x 11&quot; pages for each individual.  

Evaluation will be based on review of Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The more relevant the demonstrated experience, professional qualifications, training and education; and years of experience, the more qualified the individual shall be considered for the position proposed.  The more qualified the Offeror&#39;s proposed individuals, the higher the Offeror shall be rated.

Offerors must have a minimum of one (1) professional engineer and one (1) professional land surveyor licensed in each state of Region 8. AM#02 A copy of the license must be included in the SF330 submission. The license(s) will not count toward the AM#04 200 page limit.

Higher ratings will be assigned to those offerors with more than one licensed professional engineer and professional land surveyor in each state of Region 8; those with more than 10 years experience; and demonstrated experience performing geotechnical, hydrology and hydraulic modeling, dam assessment and dam rehabilitation experience within Region 8.

C.    Past Performance:

Offerors must be able to demonstrate successful past performance on a range of projects - variety of scope, scale and complexity.  Past performance can be submitted for the prime or subcontractors.  The Offeror&#39;s role on the projects submitted must be identified.  Successful performance can be established and substantiated from the point of view of the client, professional peers, and/or project teammates.  Demonstrated success at collaborative relationships with consultants will be positively considered.  The Government has the right to use institutional knowledge when evaluating this factor. 

Past performance will be judged and considered relevant based on the satisfactory completion of current and past contracts of a similar nature to contracts contemplated under this action including scope, complexity, and dollar value.  Satisfactory past performance shall be verified by reference checks initiated through the example projects submitted under the Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluation factor A, and may also be established through information available in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), through the Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) provided by applicable clients upon request by Offeror, through self-provided performance recognition documentation, or through institutional knowledge.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted as attachments to the SF330 and shall include either the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see attached), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluations, or self-provided performance recognition.  Offerors are required to submit past performance on at least three (3) projects, but not more than 5 projects; at least three of which must for those submitted as part of Criterion A and listed in the SF330, Part I, Section F. 

Past performance is relevant information regarding an offeror&#39;s actions under previously awarded contracts.  It includes the Offeror&#39;s overall quality of and record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, adherence to scope, schedule and budget, including the administrative aspects of performance; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, including the offeror&#39;s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

While offerors are required to submit a minimum of 3 references, but not more than 5, the government is not required to conduct or complete reference checks on more than 3 contracts.  If more than 3 references are provided, the government reserves the right to choose which references to include in its evaluation. 

In addition to those references provided directly by the Offeror, the government may identify and analyze the past performance of the Offeror on any other relevant contract of which the Contracting Officer obtains knowledge, including but not limited to projects listed in CPARS.  Because of the wide variety of past performance history of individual Offerors, the Government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained for each Offeror.

In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, failure of the Offeror to provide a minimum of three relevant references that meet the criteria listed above, and/or the inability of the Government to complete a minimum of three reference checks, after making a reasonable effort to do so, will result in the Offeror being rated as &quot;neutral&quot; on the past performance factor.

Evaluation will be based on overall past performance on contracts for similar services as judged by references who are contacted, and the references indicate that they would hire the offeror again for the same or similar services.  Documentation provided or available for review establishes satisfactory past performance on similar, relevant contracts.

The more similar the services and the better the evaluation/evaluation comments, the higher the rating.

D.    Capacity to Accomplish the Work:

This factor evaluates whether an offeror has sufficient technical resources in the various technical disciplines to accomplish the work and whether there are appropriate quality control procedures and tools available to ensure quality products and timely delivery.  

Submittal requirements for this factor include providing an organizational chart of key personnel as an attachment and indicated in Part I, Section D and Part II Architect-Engineer Qualifications-General for each firm. AM#01 Organizational Chart may be 11x17. AM#01
In addition, examples of specific project management should be submitted for no more than 3 relevant past performance projects and attached under Part I, Section H.  Each Plan submitted may also include a one-page summary outlining areas where the Plan effectively fostered goals for good project management, including schedule management, responsiveness, resource management, reporting methods, etc.

Evaluation will be based on the offeror demonstrating adequate staffing resources and the capability to perform and balance multiple task orders concurrently and to balance competing needs of multiple customers.  Submitted material should outline methods and processes the firm/team shall use to track and report project status to multiple CORs, maintain schedules and ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis.

E.    Knowledge of the Locality:

Offerors must demonstrate knowledge of the locality and the general geographic area Region 8 to successfully perform.

Submittal requirements involve fully completing Part 1, Section C to include complete addresses of proposed team, and review of Part 1, Section F Example Projects.  There are no specific additional submittal requirements for this factor.

Evaluation will be based on the location of offices and example projects within Region 8.  Offerors with one or more offices within the geographic area and/or with example projects within the geographic area with of Region 8 will receive a higher rating.

F.    Geographic Proximity: 

Criteria F is secondary criteria and will only be used as a &ldquo;tie-breaker&rdquo; among firms which are rated as technically equal after the interview phase of the selection process.  In the event of a tie, the firm with the most offices within the geographic area will break the tie.

Offeror must be able to provide services ranging from pre-design plans and studies through construction management.  Highlight areas of expertise in dam assessments, watershed rehabilitation planning, watershed planning, engineering design service and other additional services as identified above.  Examples must include evidence to demonstrate the degree of complexity of work performed.  The prime firm&#39;s experience will be weighted more heavily than subcontractor&#39;s experience.  Similar projects with a higher degree of complexity will be weighted more heavily those than with a lower degree of complexity.  

Submittal requirements for this factor must be submitted under Part I, Section F, Example Projects of the SF330 form.  Submit at least one project demonstrating expertise in each of the four primary service areas: dam assessment, watershed rehabilitation planning, watershed planning, and engineering design.  No more than two projects per service area.  For each example project / contract listed in the completed SF330, the offeror may submit no more than two (2) 8 &frac12;&quot; x 11&quot; pages containing narrative and/or graphic material.

Evaluation will be based on demonstration of the ability to provide a wide array of engineering and design services by the prime firm and any subcontractors or partners and their key personnel necessary to accomplish the requirements as outlined.

The more relevant and recent examples demonstrating experience in the four primary services as identified above, the higher the offeror shall be rated.  The larger the number of examples which are of work by prime and prime key personnel, the higher the rating.

The more diverse design and engineering experience in various types of geographic conditions (upland, marsh, watersheds, mountainous, etc.) and the higher degree of complexity of the projects, the higher the offeror shall be rated.

B.    Professional Qualifications:

Firm must possess professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services similar in nature to those required as part of this requirement.  Information shall be provided to demonstrate key personnel and other disciplines required for contract performance including professional registrations, advanced degrees and recognized designations of industry professional organizations.  Evaluation will be based upon the number of personnel; their knowledge and level of experience associated with the types of work required.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted under Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The Offeror shall provide resumes for all key personnel identified for the proposed team.  Resumes shall indicate all relevant experience, professional qualifications, training, education, past performance, team experience and expected availability of each individual listed as key personnel.  Resumes shall not exceed AM#01 two (2) 8 &frac12;&quot; x 11&quot; pages for each individual.  

Evaluation will be based on review of Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The more relevant the demonstrated experience, professional qualifications, training and education; and years of experience, the more qualified the individual shall be considered for the position proposed.  The more qualified the Offeror&#39;s proposed individuals, the higher the Offeror shall be rated.

Offerors must have a minimum of one (1) professional engineer and one (1) professional land surveyor licensed in each state of Region 7. AM#02 A copy of the license must be included in the SF330 submission. The license(s) will not count toward the AM#04 200 page limit.

Higher ratings will be assigned to those offerors with more than one licensed professional engineer and professional land surveyor in each state of Region 7; those with more than 10 years experience; and demonstrated experience performing geotechnical, hydrology and hydraulic modeling, dam assessment and dam rehabilitation experience within Region 7.

C.    Past Performance:

Offerors must be able to demonstrate successful past performance on a range of projects - variety of scope, scale and complexity.  Past performance can be submitted for the prime or subcontractors.  The Offeror&#39;s role on the projects submitted must be identified.  Successful performance can be established and substantiated from the point of view of the client, professional peers, and/or project teammates.  Demonstrated success at collaborative relationships with consultants will be positively considered.  The Government has the right to use institutional knowledge when evaluating this factor. 

Past performance will be judged and considered relevant based on the satisfactory completion of current and past contracts of a similar nature to contracts contemplated under this action including scope, complexity, and dollar value.  Satisfactory past performance shall be verified by reference checks initiated through the example projects submitted under the Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluation factor A, and may also be established through information available in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), through the Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) provided by applicable clients upon request by Offeror, through self-provided performance recognition documentation, or through institutional knowledge.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted as attachments to the SF330 and shall include either the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see attached), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluations, or self-provided performance recognition.  Offerors are required to submit past performance on at least three (3) projects, but not more than 5 projects; at least three of which must for those submitted as part of Criterion A and listed in the SF330, Part I, Section F. 

Past performance is relevant information regarding an offeror&#39;s actions under previously awarded contracts.  It includes the Offeror&#39;s overall quality of and record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, adherence to scope, schedule and budget, including the administrative aspects of performance; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, including the offeror&#39;s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

While offerors are required to submit a minimum of 3 references, but not more than 5, the government is not required to conduct or complete reference checks on more than 3 contracts.  If more than 3 references are provided, the government reserves the right to choose which references to include in its evaluation. 

In addition to those references provided directly by the Offeror, the government may identify and analyze the past performance of the Offeror on any other relevant contract of which the Contracting Officer obtains knowledge, including but not limited to projects listed in CPARS.  Because of the wide variety of past performance history of individual Offerors, the Government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained for each Offeror.

In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, failure of the Offeror to provide a minimum of three relevant references that meet the criteria listed above, and/or the inability of the Government to complete a minimum of three reference checks, after making a reasonable effort to do so, will result in the Offeror being rated as &quot;neutral&quot; on the past performance factor.

Evaluation will be based on overall past performance on contracts for similar services as judged by references who are contacted, and the references indicate that they would hire the offeror again for the same or similar services.  Documentation provided or available for review establishes satisfactory past performance on similar, relevant contracts.

The more similar the services and the better the evaluation/evaluation comments, the higher the rating.

D.    Capacity to Accomplish the Work:

This factor evaluates whether an offeror has sufficient technical resources in the various technical disciplines to accomplish the work and whether there are appropriate quality control procedures and tools available to ensure quality products and timely delivery.  

Submittal requirements for this factor include providing an organizational chart of key personnel as an attachment and indicated in Part I, Section D and Part II Architect-Engineer Qualifications-General for each firm. AM#01 Organizational Chart may be 11x17. 
In addition, examples of specific project management should be submitted for no more than 3 relevant past performance projects and attached under Part I, Section H.  Each Plan submitted may also include a one-page summary outlining areas where the Plan effectively fostered goals for good project management, including schedule management, responsiveness, resource management, reporting methods, etc.

Evaluation will be based on the offeror demonstrating adequate staffing resources and the capability to perform and balance multiple task orders concurrently and to balance competing needs of multiple customers.  Submitted material should outline methods and processes the firm/team shall use to track and report project status to multiple CORs, maintain schedules and ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis.

E.    Knowledge of the Locality:

Offerors must demonstrate knowledge of the locality and the general geographic area Region 7 to successfully perform.

Submittal requirements involve fully completing Part 1, Section C to include complete addresses of proposed team, and review of Part 1, Section F Example Projects.  There are no specific additional submittal requirements for this factor.

Evaluation will be based on the location of offices and example projects within Region 7.  Offerors with one or more offices within the geographic area and/or with example projects within the geographic area with of Region 7 will receive a higher rating.

F.    Geographic Proximity: 

Criteria F is secondary criteria and will only be used as a &ldquo;tie-breaker&rdquo; among firms which are rated as technically equal after the interview phase of the selection process.  In the event of a tie, the firm with the most offices within the geographic area will break the tie.

C.    Past Performance:

Offerors must be able to demonstrate successful past performance on a range of projects - variety of scope, scale and complexity.  Past performance can be submitted for the prime or subcontractors.  The Offeror&#39;s role on the projects submitted must be identified.  Successful performance can be established and substantiated from the point of view of the client, professional peers, and/or project teammates.  Demonstrated success at collaborative relationships with consultants will be positively considered.  The Government has the right to use institutional knowledge when evaluating this factor. 

Past performance will be judged and considered relevant based on the satisfactory completion of current and past contracts of a similar nature to contracts contemplated under this action including scope, complexity, and dollar value.  Satisfactory past performance shall be verified by reference checks initiated through the example projects submitted under the Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluation factor A, and may also be established through information available in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), through the Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) provided by applicable clients upon request by Offeror, through self-provided performance recognition documentation, or through institutional knowledge.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted as attachments to the SF330 and shall include either the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see attached), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluations, or self-provided performance recognition.  Offerors are required to submit past performance on at least three (3) projects, but not more than 5 projects; at least three of which must for those submitted as part of Criterion A and listed in the SF330, Part I, Section F. 

Past performance is relevant information regarding an offeror&#39;s actions under previously awarded contracts.  It includes the Offeror&#39;s overall quality of and record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, adherence to scope, schedule and budget, including the administrative aspects of performance; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, including the offeror&#39;s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

While offerors are required to submit a minimum of 3 references, but not more than 5, the government is not required to conduct or complete reference checks on more than 3 contracts.  If more than 3 references are provided, the government reserves the right to choose which references to include in its evaluation. 

In addition to those references provided directly by the Offeror, the government may identify and analyze the past performance of the Offeror on any other relevant contract of which the Contracting Officer obtains knowledge, including but not limited to projects listed in CPARS.  Because of the wide variety of past performance history of individual Offerors, the Government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained for each Offeror.

In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, failure of the Offeror to provide a minimum of three relevant references that meet the criteria listed above, and/or the inability of the Government to complete a minimum of three reference checks, after making a reasonable effort to do so, will result in the Offeror being rated as &quot;neutral&quot; on the past performance factor.

Evaluation will be based on overall past performance on contracts for similar services as judged by references who are contacted, and the references indicate that they would hire the offeror again for the same or similar services.  Documentation provided or available for review establishes satisfactory past performance on similar, relevant contracts.

The more similar the services and the better the evaluation/evaluation comments, the higher the rating.

The more relevant and recent examples demonstrating experience in the four primary services as identified above, the higher the offeror shall be rated.  The larger the number of examples which are of work by prime and prime key personnel, the higher the rating.

The more diverse design and engineering experience in various types of geographic conditions (upland, marsh, watersheds, mountainous, etc.) and the higher degree of complexity of the projects, the higher the offeror shall be rated.

B.    Professional Qualifications:

Firm must possess professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services similar in nature to those required as part of this requirement.  Information shall be provided to demonstrate key personnel and other disciplines required for contract performance including professional registrations, advanced degrees and recognized designations of industry professional organizations.  Evaluation will be based upon the number of personnel; their knowledge and level of experience associated with the types of work required.

The Offeror shall provide resumes for all key personnel identified for the proposed team.  Resumes shall indicate all relevant experience, professional qualifications, training, education, past performance, team experience and expected availability of each individual listed as key personnel.  Resumes shall not exceed AM#01 TWO (2) 8 &frac12;&quot; x 11&quot; pages for each individual.  

Evaluation will be based on review of Part I, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel.  The more relevant the demonstrated experience, professional qualifications, training and education; and years of experience, the more qualified the individual shall be considered for the position proposed.  The more qualified the Offeror&#39;s proposed individuals, the higher the Offeror shall be rated.

Offerors must have a minimum of one (1) professional engineer and one (1) professional land surveyor licensed in each state of Region 5. AM#02 A copy of the license must be included in the SF330 submission. The license(s) will not count toward the AM#05 200 page limit.

Higher ratings will be assigned to those offerors with more than one licensed professional engineer and professional land surveyor in each state of Region 5; those with more than 10 years experience; and demonstrated experience performing geotechnical, hydrology and hydraulic modeling, dam assessment and dam rehabilitation experience within Region 5.

C.    Past Performance:

Offerors must be able to demonstrate successful past performance on a range of projects - variety of scope, scale and complexity.  Past performance can be submitted for the prime or subcontractors.  The Offeror&#39;s role on the projects submitted must be identified.  Successful performance can be established and substantiated from the point of view of the client, professional peers, and/or project teammates.  Demonstrated success at collaborative relationships with consultants will be positively considered.  The Government has the right to use institutional knowledge when evaluating this factor. 

Past performance will be judged and considered relevant based on the satisfactory completion of current and past contracts of a similar nature to contracts contemplated under this action including scope, complexity, and dollar value.  Satisfactory past performance shall be verified by reference checks initiated through the example projects submitted under the Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluation factor A, and may also be established through information available in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), through the Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) provided by applicable clients upon request by Offeror, through self-provided performance recognition documentation, or through institutional knowledge.

Submittal requirements for this factor shall be submitted as attachments to the SF330 and shall include either the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see attached), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) evaluations, or self-provided performance recognition.  Offerors are required to submit past performance on at least three (3) projects, but not more than 5 projects; at least three of which must for those submitted as part of Criterion A and listed in the SF330, Part I, Section F. 

Past performance is relevant information regarding an offeror&#39;s actions under previously awarded contracts.  It includes the Offeror&#39;s overall quality of and record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, adherence to scope, schedule and budget, including the administrative aspects of performance; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, including the offeror&#39;s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

While offerors are required to submit a minimum of 3 references, but not more than 5, the government is not required to conduct or complete reference checks on more than 3 contracts.  If more than 3 references are provided, the government reserves the right to choose which references to include in its evaluation. 

In addition to those references provided directly by the Offeror, the government may identify and analyze the past performance of the Offeror on any other relevant contract of which the Contracting Officer obtains knowledge, including but not limited to projects listed in CPARS.  Because of the wide variety of past performance history of individual Offerors, the Government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained for each Offeror.

In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, failure of the Offeror to provide a minimum of three relevant references that meet the criteria listed above, and/or the inability of the Government to complete a minimum of three reference checks, after making a reasonable effort to do so, will result in the Offeror being rated as &quot;neutral&quot; on the past performance factor.

Evaluation will be based on overall past performance on contracts for similar services as judged by references who are contacted, and the references indicate that they would hire the offeror again for the same or similar services.  Documentation provided or available for review establishes satisfactory past performance on similar, relevant contracts.

The more similar the services and the better the evaluation/evaluation comments, the higher the rating.

D.     Capacity to Accomplish the Work:

This factor evaluates whether an offeror has sufficient technical resources in the various technical disciplines to accomplish the work and whether there are appropriate quality control procedures and tools available to ensure quality products and timely delivery.  

Submittal requirements for this factor include providing an organizational chart of key personnel as an attachment and indicated in Part I, Section D and Part II Architect-Engineer Qualifications-General for each firm. AM#01 Organizational Chart may be 11x17.
In addition, examples of specific project management should be submitted for no more than 3 relevant past performance projects and attached under Part I, Section H.  Each Plan submitted may also include a one-page summary outlining areas where the Plan effectively fostered goals for good project management, including schedule management, responsiveness, resource management, reporting methods, etc.

Evaluation will be based on the offeror demonstrating adequate staffing resources and the capability to perform and balance multiple task orders concurrently and to balance competing needs of multiple customers.  Submitted material should outline methods and processes the firm/team shall use to track and report project status to multiple CORs, maintain schedules and ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis.

E.    Knowledge of the Locality:

Offerors must demonstrate knowledge of the locality and the general geographic area Region 5 to successfully perform.

Submittal requirements involve fully completing Part 1, Section C to include complete addresses of proposed team, and review of Part 1, Section F Example Projects.  There are no specific additional submittal requirements for this factor.

Evaluation will be based on the location of offices and example projects within Region 5.  Offerors with one or more offices within the geographic area and/or with example projects within the geographic area with of Region 5 will receive a higher rating.

F.     Geographic Proximity 

Criteria F is secondary criteria and will only be used as a &ldquo;tie-breaker&rdquo; among firms which are rated as technically equal after the interview phase of the selection process.  In the event of a tie, the firm with the most offices within the geographic area will break the tie.

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

This is a Sources Sought Notice and is for informational/market research purposes only. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from all qualified and interested parties for a potential single contract to provide the full Design Services and Construction Phase Support Services for the U.S Department of Agriculture, Foreign Disease-Weed Science Research Laboratory (FDWSRL) Modernization.

The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 and the standard size is $16.5M. This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.

This project will be executed for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Services (USDA, ARS) by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Baltimore District. The project consists of a new Laboratory/Head house/Greenhouse facility at Fort Detrick, MD, to support the ongoing research of the Foreign Disease Weed Science Research Unit (FDWSRU). The project is currently at approximately 35% stage of design.

The project scope of work includes the construction of a new BSL-3 Plant Pathogen Containment facility consisting of a combined laboratory and biocontainment Head house/Greenhouse which will be adjacent to Buildings 1301-1309 complex. The new building will be approximately 67,420 GSF with two stories and a full basement.  The north half is the Biocontainment Lab with a group of 4 Research Greenhouses  along the south fa&ccedil;ade. The new facility will serve as a replacement for Buildings 374 (BSL-3 Plant Pathogen Containment) and 390 (Effluent Decontamination System) located on Fort Detrick. The main floor (Level 1) will be dedicated to research and primary support spaces, with a full basement below for the central utility plant, waste treatment equipment, and biocontainment inspection access to the plumbing systems. Level 2 (above the Lab) is dedicated entirely for mechanical and electrical systems, with an elevated Mezzanine for the Air Handling Units (AHU&rsquo;s) and Exhaust Fan Units (EFU&rsquo;s).

The FDWSRU currently occupies two sites at Ft. Detrick, with the pathogen containment lab and greenhouses (Bldg. 374) located on a small site in the southwest portion of the Post. While this facility is in the middle of significant renovations to maintain performance and research capabilities, the building has passed its seventh decade in operation and is need of retirement. The new Science Research Lab (FDWSRL) will replace the existing building with a larger, more functional facility co-located within the fenced perimeter of the main USDA complex (Buildings 1301-1309). The new FDWSRL will be a significant upgrade to the USDA&rsquo;s facilities at the Post, including new sealed greenhouses capable of pathogen containment research.

THIS PROJECT IS PLANNED AS DESIGN-BID-BUILD.

80076ad7fa34472ca3811dc4c7e84780,1305M221RFI0010a,Environmental Sensors and Equipment,"This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quote and does not constitute a commitment by the Government. The Government is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to identify potential sources to fulfill the requirement and gather information on current capabilities of businesses within the market. All information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. Note, this is related to a Request for Information that was published on SAM.gov under Notice ID 1305M221RFI0010 on Jan 04, 2022. This is a supplemental Sources Sought Notice.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD), Norfolk, VA on behalf of the National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Observations (OBS), is conducting market research to determine potential sources to provide replacement sensors and peripheral equipment for NWS fielded surface observing systems. The anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing. The size standard for this NAICS is 1,250 employees.

Background: The NWS OBS is responsible for the operations and maintenance of fielded systems that sense the atmosphere in support of surface-based Aviation Operations, Climate and Ship Observing. There are three programs OBS manages supporting surface observations: (1) Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS); (2) National Cooperative Observer Program (COOP); and (3) Volunteer Observer Program (VOS).

The ASOS is an essential, joint mission in support of the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD).  The ASOS is the nation&#39;s primary system for collecting and reporting surface-weather observations, primarily at airports, in support of aviation operations as well as weather forecasting and the timely issuance of warnings. There are approximately 960 ASOS sites globally.

The NWS National COOP was established with the Organic Act, 15 USC 313 of 1890 &ldquo;to the distribution of meteorological information in the interests of agriculture and commerce, and the taking of such meteorological observations as may be necessary to establish and record the climatic conditions of the United States, or as are essential for the proper execution of the foregoing duties.&rdquo; Thus, the purpose of the Program is to provide accurate and reliable observational hydrometeorological data.



The VOS is the primary ocean-based surface observation collection network on NOAA ships and other ocean-going volunteer vessels.  Environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction are taken from a variety of points along shipping routes and used in a variety of applications.

Multiple sensors, radios and peripheral equipment used by the OBS surface observing systems are approaching the end-of-service life and require replacement to maintain the high reliability and continuity of operations necessary to support operational needs and the Weather Ready Nation concept. The government requires Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) sensors and peripheral equipment capable of interfacing with the systems to which they are attached.

Standard brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this notice. Submitted Capability Statements shall include the following:

1.     Company name and address

2.     Unique System for Award Management Identification Number

3.     Type of business (e.g. large, small, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women- owned small business, and/or economically disadvantaged women-owned small business) as validated in the SAM including the business size standard applicable to the NAICS code referenced in this Sources Sought Notice.

4.     Company point of contact &ndash; name, phone number, and email address

5.     Clear explanation of capabilities to meet, as well as manage multiple projects at one time, for the requirements listed below:


	Capabilities to provide ASOS program support &ndash; this includes viable solutions for procurement of these type of sensors
	Capabilities to provide COOP program support &ndash; this includes viable solutions for procurement of these type of sensors
	Capabilities to provide VOS program support &ndash; this includes viable solutions for procurement of these type of sensors
	Capabilities to provide necessary hardware and power supplies &ndash; this includes viable solutions for installation of the sensors

001) Drone with Imager and Camera

Scope of Work:

The USDA-ARS Cereal Corps Research Unit (CCRU) in Madison, WI is requesting quotes for a drone with imager and camera.

Background: 

In this project we are screening a large collection of barley accessions that are known as the iCore diversity panel to identify lines that are tolerant to abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, combined heat and drought stress as well as germination traits, growth stature, lodging and heading date. Such lines will then be analyzed to determine the molecular mechanism governing the tolerance trait and used in breeding programs to develop varieties with improved tolerance to abiotic stress.  The drone will be used to capture data throughout the growing season with the intent of developing spectral profiles associated with traits mentioned above. Additionally, we will be evaluating the image profiles to determine if malt quality factors such as protein content and seed color can be captured in the spectral profiles which will increase our ability to phenotype these traits and predict malt quality of grains as they mature in the field. The Walling laboratory currently does not have a UAV for monitoring field samples. The drone will be used on a biweekly basis throughout the growing season to monitor our barley accessions at a few field locations. This instrument is crucial to the needs of our research projects, to fulfill the requirements outlined in our CRIS.

      (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

(2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is &quot;late&quot; and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-

                     (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

                     (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government&rsquo;s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

      (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror&rsquo;s initial offer should contain the offeror&rsquo;s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.

SELECTION CRITERIA:  The source selection factors for this procurement are listed below in descending order of importance. Factors 1 through 6 are primary. Factor 7 is secondary and will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. Primary factors will be assigned a rating from &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; to &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo;, based on the risk to the Government that the Offeror will successfully perform that evaluated factor. An overall rating will also be applied to the proposal submission using the same rating scale. Proposals failing to respond or provide complete information for each factor, as required by this solicitation, will be determined non-compliant and will be removed from further consideration. After all ratings have been assigned, Offerors will be ranked as &ldquo;Most Highly Qualified,&rdquo; &ldquo;Highly Qualified,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not Qualified&rdquo; in accordance with EP 715-1-7 Architect-Engineer Contracting In USACE.



For purposes of this solicitation, a stand-alone contract (such as a &ldquo;C&rdquo; or &ldquo;P&rdquo;-type contract) or single task order under an Indefinite Delivery Contract is considered one project. Separating activities performed under a contract or task order will not be considered multiple projects; conversely, combining activities performed under separate contracts or task orders to produce a single project will not be considered. Projects in which the AE Service is not 75% complete will not be evaluated.  A project is considered 75% complete when 75% of the funding has been expended and/or 75 % of the scope of work has been completed.

Project 7 - Investigation of Emerging Contaminants and/or Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)



Additional projects submitted for evaluation are not required to be a particular emphasis area. Projects in which the AE Service is not 75% complete will not be evaluated. A project is considered 75% complete when 75% of the funding has been expended and/or 75 % of the scope of work has been completed. All projects must have been conducted within five (5) years of publication of this solicitation announcement (see Block 22) and must be 75% complete at the publication of this solicitation announcement.  At least six (6) of the projects presented must show that the Offeror (the firm submitting the SF330 as the prime contractor), whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor, performed the majority (&gt;50%) of the work on the project.  To demonstrate such performance, Offerors are to specifically describe the type(s) of work performed and state the percentage they performed of each type of work.  If a proposed subcontractor also worked on the project, state the type(s) and percentage(s) of work it performed.  If an Offeror submits more than six (6) projects, those projects must reflect performance of work by the Offeror, or one or more of its proposed subcontractors.  For each such project state the percentage of work performed by the Offeror, and/or the percentage of work performed by each proposed subcontractor. Clearly identify the Project Number (as indicated above), Type and the Offeror&rsquo;s role on the project. In Block 24, &ldquo;cost&rdquo; is the total value of the project, not simply the value of the work performed by the Offeror and/or any proposed subcontractor. The Government reserves the right to review any official performance evaluation system of records to inform its source selection decision. When completing Section G, in Block 26, along with the name of key personnel, include the firm with whom the person is or was associated at the time the project was performed. 



Those firms submitting as Joint Ventures (JV) must follow the same procedures as any other Offeror with the following exception. If the JV (the Offeror) cannot provide at least six (6) projects that demonstrate performance by the JV of 50% or more of a project, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor, the JV may provide projects performed by any partner of the offering JV that reflect performance of 50% or more of a project, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor. JV Offerors are not required to submit projects of both partners but more consideration may be given for projects that were performed as a JV.



Of the projects submitted as prescribed above, relevant projects are those that reflect the specialized experience and technical competence of the Offeror and/or proposed subcontractor(s), as prime contractors or subcontractors, performing services similar to those described above in the paragraph titled Project Information. More weight will be given to experience with complex HTRW projects that are of scope, magnitude, and complexity similar to that described above in the paragraph titled Project Information as well as projects demonstrating a breadth of experiences, described in detail, with diverse and varied stakeholders, regulatory statutes and programs, media, hydrogeology, contaminants, and contaminant concentrations. This factor may be assessed Strengths or Weaknesses, as appropriate.



The basis of evaluation for Factor 2 will be information submitted in Part I, Sections F and G.



Factor 3.  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence (Technical Capabilities) (SF330, Part I, Section H)



In Part I, Section H, the Offeror must provide a proposed work management plan demonstrating its team&rsquo;s breadth of knowledge and experience with complex HTRW project support for Military, Civil, and Federal Agencies. The narrative should describe the corporate approach, driving criteria or potential constraints, and examples of successful performance. The narrative should specifically discuss knowledge of, and experience with, work management planning to include quality management, subcontractor management, prior experience of the prime firm and any significant consultant, version control management, proactive internal and external communication protocols, electronic systems and/or software used in budget, schedule and quality management, and independent submittal review processes in the context of providing services under multiple task orders. This factor may be assessed Strengths or Weaknesses, as appropriate.



Factor 4.  Past Performance (SF330, Part I, Section H)



Offerors shall demonstrate in narrative (or other format) a history of customer satisfaction with the Offeror&#39;s quality of work, cost control and scheduling. Past Performance history is not to be limited to information presented in Factor 2. Past performance can be substantiated by presentation of CPARS or PPQ ratings, or customer ratings from other project evaluation systems. Customer excerpts or quotes from prior evaluations for the purposes of substantiating the narrative are not desired. The narrative should describe the corporate approach for maintaining success with customer satisfaction with the Offeror&#39;s quality of work, cost control and scheduling. This factor may be assessed Strengths or Weaknesses, as appropriate, with more weight given to successful performance ratings in these three areas on Department of Defense contracts.  



Factor 5.  Capacity to Accomplish the Work (SF330, Part I, Section H)



All Unrestricted Offerors are to clearly demonstrate the capacity to accomplish at least three (3) $500,000 task orders simultaneously. All SB Offerors are to clearly demonstrate the capacity to accomplish at least three (3) $225,000 task orders simultaneously. This factor may be assessed Strengths or Weaknesses, as appropriate.



Factor 6.  Knowledge of Locality (SF330, Part I, Section H)



Offerors are to clearly demonstrate their cost expertise, cost databases, and estimating programs, for environmental remediation and removal programs and knowledge of the locality of AE services to support the Environmental Restoration Program given ER 1110-3-1301. The narrative should describe the any known features that are unusual or uniquely specific to cost for the Environmental Restoration Program. More consideration will be given to narratives demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the differing programs and challenges therein requiring cost engineering support for the Environmental Restoration Program. This factor may be assessed Strengths or Weaknesses, as appropriate.



Factor 7.  SB and SDB Participation (SF330, Part I, Section H)



Offerors shall provide the extent of participation of small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. The participation is to be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the small businesses, small, disadvantaged businesses, historically black colleges and universities, or minority institutions are the prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration. This factor is not to be confused with a formal subcontracting plan. This factor is a secondary criterion and will only be evaluated as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. 



Interviews.  As required by acquisition regulations, interviews for the purpose of discussing prospective contractor qualifications will be conducted by the AE Evaluation Board (Selection Board). Interviews will be held with those offerors deemed by the Board to be qualified for award.  Interviews will be conducted by telephone and will most likely occur the same week that the Selection Board convenes. Phone calls and personal visits for the purpose of discussing this solicitation are not allowed.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a solicitation Announcement or Request for Quote. It does not constitute any commitment by the Government. No award will result from this notice. The purpose is to conduct market research to gain knowledge of potentially qualified sources and to determine the capability of Small Business and/or Large Business companies to provide the supplies/services described below. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice will be used by the Government to make an appropriate acquisition decision. Department of Agriculture (ARS) requests responses from ALL socioeconomic categories in order to gain a more complete understanding of the market for these products and service.

The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) will not award a contract on the basis of responses or pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice. After completing an analysis of the responses, the Government will determine whether to limit competition to 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, Women-Owned, or other small business firms, or to proceed with issuing an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.

The NAICS code for the expected acquisition is 336411, with a Size Standard of 1,500 employees and the PSC Code is 1550.

001) Drone with Imager and Camera

Scope of Work:

The USDA-ARS Cereal Corps Research Unit (CCRU) in Madison, WI is seeking sources for a drone with imager and camera.

Background: 

In this project we are screening a large collection of barley accessions that are known as the iCore diversity panel to identify lines that are tolerant to abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, combined heat and drought stress as well as germination traits, growth stature, lodging and heading date. Such lines will then be analyzed to determine the molecular mechanism governing the tolerance trait and used in breeding programs to develop varieties with improved tolerance to abiotic stress.  The drone will be used to capture data throughout the growing season with the intent of developing spectral profiles associated with traits mentioned above. Additionally, we will be evaluating the image profiles to determine if malt quality factors such as protein content and seed color can be captured in the spectral profiles which will increase our ability to phenotype these traits and predict malt quality of grains as they mature in the field. The Walling laboratory currently does not have a UAV for monitoring field samples. The drone will be used on a biweekly basis throughout the growing season to monitor our barley accessions at a few field locations. This instrument is crucial to the needs of our research projects, to fulfill the requirements outlined in our CRIS.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) Technical Acceptability, (ii) Price, and (iii) Past Performance.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 12505B21Q0176 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2021-06. This solicitation will be a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 333999 with a small business size standard of 500 employees and the PSC code is 6695.

The Department of Agriculture (ARS) has the need for the following products:

001) Seed Counter

Scope of Work:

The USDA-ARS North Central Region Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS) located in Ames, IA is requesting quotes for a seed counter for processing and filling seed requests.

Background: 

The current seed counters utilized by the NCRPIS seed storage and distribution group are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have reached or exceeded design life. Accurate, efficient counting of seed to fill accession requests received through GRIN-Global is essential to meeting the mission goals of the program.

Technical Requirements:

The quoted unit must meet the following requirements.


	Easy clean out of remnant seed after counting of seed lot is complete without removing a bowl or part of machine. Discharge of remnant seed should be fast and complete.
	Clearly defined seed loading chamber for ease of loading adequate source seed and not overload.
	Quiet operation. Most seed counters are vibration, bowl-based technology which generates noise level high enough to advise hearing protection. Seed counter not based on vibration technology preferred to reduce worker noise exposure.
	Barcode scanning capability to verify correct seed identity and seed counts in each packet. Scanning system that is a camera based, smart barcode reader compatible with multiple bar code types (Aztec, Data Matrix, and QR) and able to learn new systems. Advanced barcode system must meet our current standard and can adapt to future changes.
	Carousel to allow counting multiple packets for same seed source. Reduces repetitive motion pattern for operator and reduces potential for errors. Carousel unit to allow each packet to be barcode scanned and capable of 1 to 10+ packets per entry.
	Self-contained unit that does not require link to laptop or pad computer to operate with full functionality. This reduces cost of operation and seed lab space needed to operate.
	Space need for unit must be compatible with current seed lab workstations. Seed counting workstations allow for 30&rdquo; x 36&rdquo; work bench area for seed counter.
	Access to proven service of unit after purchase. Seed counters being replaced can no longer be serviced.       


Evaluation Factors: 

Quotes will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1.  Technical performance as outlined above

2.  Price relative to technical performance

3.  Manufacturer technical and service support

Key Deliverables:


	Seed Counter
	Foot Switch
	Hand Held Bar Code Scanning Capability
	USB Data Port
	Standard Envelope Bar Code Reader

1. SYNOPSIS: Architect and Engineering services, procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36, are required to plan and design a new ARS USDA Forage Animal Production Research Laboratory and other associated improvements in the vicinity of Lexington, Kentucky. Work will be considered to be performed primarily at the Architect/Engineer&rsquo;s (A/E) office.  However, site visits and meetings are anticipated to be conducted at facilities owned by the University of Kentucky.  These meetings may be held in facilities at the main University of Kentucky Lexington campus or in facilities owned by the University of Kentucky in the areas surrounding Lexington Kentucky that support agricultural research. Awards will be made as Firm-Fixed-Price Task Orders during the period of performance. The total combined contract capacity under the Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) pool is not to exceed $10,000,000 over a five-year period. This is a five-year contract, with no option years. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders, but the total value of task orders awarded will not exceed the overall SATOC capacity. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. The Firm that is selected for negotiation of a contract may be required to submit additional information at a later time for use in the evaluation of qualifications for specific Task Orders. The period of performance for task orders issued under these contracts may extend beyond the five-year ordering period.



In accordance with FAR 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $35,000 will receive a performance evaluation. A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time. Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for Architect-Engineer Services.

Evaluation Criteria



Content and Rating.  Proposals shall be specific and complete in every detail and shall contain the information necessary to properly assess and evaluate the Contractor&#39;s capability to perform the specified contract services, based upon the following factors:




	Specialized Experience/Past Performance
	Design Quality Management Plan




The information provided on the SF330s will be used to evaluate each Offeror&rsquo;s proposal.  The Government will evaluate the proposals in accordance with the criteria described herein, and award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Contract (IDIQ) contract to the responsible offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and who is deemed the most highly qualified.  Task orders will be negotiated against the IDIQ contract.  Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the factors contained in the following paragraphs. 





 

Specialized Experience/Past Performance.  Offerors will be evaluated on the following: 



The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will evaluate the relevancy of the submitted projects in comparison to the project description for this solicitation.  Projects that are determined to be very relevant will receive more consideration than projects that are considered to be relevant or somewhat relevant.  The government will also evaluate how well the offeror performed on the projects that were submitted as evidence of specialized experience/past performance.  The Government reserves the right to check any or all cited references to verify supplied information and to assess owner satisfaction.  The Government also reserves the right to not contact the provided references.  In addition to the information submitted by the offeror, the Government reserves the right to review any other sources of relevant information for evaluating past performance, including projects other than those submitted by the offeror.  The Government will, at a minimum, review past performance information retrieved through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/Unique Entity Identifier numbers.  Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved from inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.



The Government will consider information in the Past Performance Questionnaires completed by personnel for whom the Offeror has performed work, and any information obtained from other sources.  Evaluation of specialized experience/past performance will be based on subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government&#39;s conclusions about the overall quality of the Offeror&#39;s past performance may influence the selection of the proposal.



Offerors may receive additional consideration if they have successfully completed previous design experience work with either the USDA or the USACE.  Offerors may also receive additional consideration for professionals identified in Section E. that have worked previously on any of the submitted projects from Section F.  Offerors that demonstrate experience with planning and/or design charrettes, especially on projects that involve scientific research or construction project in a University setting may receive additional consideration.  Offerors that demonstrate expertise in the planning and design of complete veterinary facilities that could support the housing, monitored feeding, removal of waste, medicating, hoisting, euthanizing, and diagnosing of small and large farm animals may also receive additional consideration. 



Design Quality Management Plan. Offerors will be evaluated on the following:



Design Quality Management Plan narratives will be evaluated based on the level of understanding of the design process and the involvement the lead designers will have in the management, oversight, control, and coordination of the design work performed during the design of the project. Narratives that demonstrate a clear understanding of the design process involved in agricultural research facilities and provide a thorough approach for successfully managing the specialized requirements for agricultural research facilities may receive additional consideration by the SSEB.  The offeror&rsquo;s organizational chart will be evaluated based on the clarity, adequacy, and capabilities for successfully managing the solicited project.

 

Evaluation Process

 

The SSEB will be comprised of representatives of the Corps of Engineers, User/Customer, and other required personnel.  Offerors are advised that the evaluation and rating of proposals will be conducted in strict confidence.  Reviews of non-price factors will be conducted prior to any rates or pricing being submitted.  The number and identities of offerors will not be revealed to anyone who is not involved in the evaluation and award process or to other offerors.



The evaluation process will consist of the following two parts:




	Specialized Experience and past performance evaluation
	
		The SSEB will evaluate and rate the proposals against the solicitation requirements.
		
			Using the relevancy ratings and confidence assessments defined in the tables below, these non-price factors will be evaluated based on the extent of recent and relevant past experience, and the quality of the offeror&rsquo;s performance during that experience.
		
		
	
	





	Design Quality Management Plan
	
		The SSEB will evaluate and rate the proposals against the solicitation requirements.

026c636850ef4762ade04dd14a500fc8,W912EP21Z0023,Notice of Intent for Geophysical Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) Survey within the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) A-2 Reservoir Footprint,"THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) &ldquo;Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements&rdquo;, to Collier Geophysics, LLC, to serve as the expert consultant for Geophysical TEM Survey. This service will be delivered to the Jacksonville District, USACE. NAICS Code is 541330, and size standard is $16.5 Million.

This procurement requires a geophysical TEM survey with an AgTEM cart along approximately 245 miles of serpentine transects within the proposed Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) A-2 Reservoir footprint. This procurement also requires a vendor to provide a series of conventional ERT ground truthing transects based on field observations totaling up to 8.5 miles. The project area is located south of the City of Belle Glade in Palm Beach County, Florida on the western side of U.S. Route 27 between the Miami and New River canals.

This procurement requires geophysical investigation to:


	Characterize the pre-construction subsurface conditions in 3D within and directly adjacent to the project area;
	More precisely map variations in groundwater quality and lithostratigraphy within, and adjacent to, the project area based on TEM data calibrated to existing borings;
	Collect high resolution 3D terrestrial resistivity data;
	Characterize the depth to, and lateral extent of brackish groundwater to a minimum depth of 200 ft below ground surface (bgs).


USACE&rsquo;s traditional means of evaluating the occurrence of brackish groundwater is based on periodic geophysical logging of monitoring wells. A geophysical monitoring program adjacent to the Herbert Hoover Dike seepage cutoff wall is ongoing, as required by the State of Florida. Geophysical logging of 39 monitor wells provides depths of brackish groundwater at discrete points along the 100-mile circumference of Lake Okeechobee. This approach is appropriate for a large geographic area but does not provide the spatial resolution to define subsurface conditions beneath a much smaller footprint (12,000 acres, 17-mile periphery) at the EAA A-2 reservoir. Data acquired using the AgTEM system will result in a detailed characterization of hydrogeologic conditions to depths of up to 300 ft bgs. This data will be critically important for the development of a long-term groundwater monitoring program, and characterization of brackish groundwater for subsequent groundwater flow model development efforts.

The AgTEM system is available in the CONUS only through Collier Geophysics, LLC (590 E South Loop Stephenville, TX 76401). Collier Geophysics, LLC has a three-year exclusivity agreement with Groundwater Imaging to be the sole provider of the technology in the CONUS. All Sub-licensees will be subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. Collier Geophysics, LLC has significant specific geophysical and system knowledge that is required for properly operating and interpreting that data collected by the AgTEM system and its implications for the project area. In consideration of the above, Collier Geophysics, LLC is uniquely qualified for the award of the new USACE-SAJ contract to collect subsurface resistivity data at the EAA A-2 Reservoir.

TITLE OF CONTRACT



Purchase of SmartGPS Tracking Collars for Raccoons and Opossums with corresponding Base Stations.



BACKGROUND
 

Wildlife research frequently requires documenting locations of study animals to determine where they live, forage, and reproduce as a basis for further determination of their activities on the landscape.  When researching important details such as potential for disease transmission or damage to agriculture or other resources, accurate and precise locational information is essential to answering these questions.  Traditionally, Very High Frequency (VHF) radio collars were used to collect this type of information, though have been replaced by collars providing far less locational uncertainty by incorporating global positioning system (GPS) technology.  By using traditional VHF collars, combined with GPS technology, animal locations are obtained with much less effort and are more  reliable and spatially accurate.  Most recently, collar and GPS technology has advanced further to the point of allowing one-way and two-way communications (i.e., bluetooth technology, UHF transmission, Iridium satellites) between collars, downloading base stations, and researchers collecting information.  These communications enable researchers to acquire locational information remotely without recapturing the animal to retrieve data on the collar.

Additional desired features such as temperature and activity sensors, remote drop-off mechanisms, and SmartGPS enhance the ability of researchers to provide more answers. 

TYPE OF CONTRACT

This will be a one-time  firm-fixed Price Purchase Order for items meeting the specifications and terms herein.

REQUIREMENTS

01/29/2021

RE: 1240BH21R0003

This is not a request for Quote &ndash; This is a notice of the government&rsquo;s intent to issue a sole source award to Otak, Inc, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1), only one responsible source is available and no other services will satisfy the agency&rsquo;s requirements.

This is a sole source justification for the Lamonta Interagency Fire Operations Building on the Ochoco National Forest. This is a justification for other than full and open competition for a natural follow-on contract to update a design previously completed by the contractor in 2011.         

This project is an update to a design completed by Otak, Inc. in 2011. Otak provided full construction drawings and specifications with the original design contract, however, building code has since changed, as has the Forest Service space policy and security policy requirements. With the amount of time that has passed since the original design, the unit&rsquo;s needs have also changed slightly in terms of personnel numbers. This requirement is to update aspects of the original design to meet current codes, without having to contract out a full redesign of the building, which would be much more time and cost intensive.             

The services involved in this project include a design update to existing construction drawings and specifications for a new office building

The contractor is very familiar with the project as they prepared all of the drawings and in-depth specifications.  Otak has the experience collaborating with the unit and the city of Prineville on the design needs and permitting requirements. Updating the existing design to meet current code and policies would be much more time intensive and costly to the Government with another contractor who has no familiarity with the existing design. In addition, with Oregon licensing requirements, if another firm were to be awarded the design update, they would be required to completely redo all of the drawings and calculations as they cannot proceed with a design stamped by a different engineer without compromising their license. An architect cannot seal plans, drawings, documents, specifications or reports not prepared fully by them, according to the code. The cost of the project would likely double if awarded to a different firm than the original designer due to these regulations.

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement by February 8, 2021, 12:00 PM, PST to the Point of Contact listed below.  A determination by the Government not to compete the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Custom GPS Tracking Collars for Racoons and Opossums





The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) Wildlife Services in Fort Collins, CO, is issuing this Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Contract.  This is not a request for proposal.  This Notice does not represent a commitment by the government to pay costs incurred from the preparation and/or submission of data in response to this notice.



 USDA APHIS WS intends to issue a noncompetitive contract to Telemetry Solutions Inc. 5051 Commercial Circle, Suite A, Concord, CA 94520 in accordance FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Information regarding the intended sole source award is listed below.



Description: Wildlife research frequently requires documenting locations of study animals to determine where they live, forage, and reproduce as a basis for further determination of their activities on the landscape.  When researching important details such as potential for disease transmission or damage to agriculture or other resources, accurate and precise locational information is essential to answering these questions.  Traditionally, VHF radio collars were used to collect this type of information, though have been replaced by collars providing far less locational uncertainty by incorporating global positioning system (GPS) technology.  By using traditional VHF collars, combined with GPS technology, animal locations are obtained with much less effort and are more reliable and spatially accurate.  Most recently, radio collar and GPS technology has advanced further to the point of allowing one-way and two-way communications (i.e., UHF transmission, Iridium satellites) between collars and researchers collecting information.  These communications enable researchers to acquire locational information remotely without recapturing the animal to retrieve data on the collar.  Researchers are also able to change GPS location recording schedules and collar drop-off dates remotely, and as needed throughout a study to get more information or even less information to extend the battery life of the collar. 

Additional desired features such as temperature and activity sensors, and remote drop-off mechanisms enhance the ability of researchers to provide more answers.  A virtual fence option is also available which can alert researchers to wildlife movements and automatically provide additional information when a collared animal enters a pre-determined area, such as a baiting area.  The virtual fence is ideal for documenting activity within an area of concern such as a crop field where damage by target animals is occurring. 

            Testing the efficacy of bait delivery devices and baiting strategies is key to registering a new toxic bait for wildlife.  Nontarget access to bait delivery devices can be problematic, especially if nontargets are threatened or endangered species.  Raccoon and opossums are nontargets that frequently try to access our bait deliver boxes and are susceptible to toxic bait if enough is consumed.  Realtime or near real-time locational data that VHF/GPS collars provides are key to measuring bait delivery box effectiveness at excluding nontargets such as raccoons and opossums.

Building Control Systems for Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)

This subtopic solicits proposals
investigating innovative solutions for the refinement, integration, and
expansion of existing building management systems and tools for CEA
applications. Advanced building control systems for CEA, can be considered
analogous to building management systems, but customized for integration into
the unique processes and requirements of indoor farms. Current CEA control
systems may include some level of connectivity between equipment of moderate
efficiency and are intended to optimize the internal conditions for maximum
plant quality and growth. This limited amount of integration/connectivity with
other building management systems does not allow for smart decisions to be made
regarding how and when equipment should operate to optimize energy and water
costs, provide grid benefits while still maximizing plant quality and growth.
CEA is a rapidly expanding market and currently DOE estimates that these
technologies, when paired with high-efficiency integrated equipment, have the
potential to save 50-100 TBTu/yr in the U.S. For more information, applicants
should refer to the listed building automation system project pages [1, 2, 3].

 

Specifically, DOE is interested in
proposals in the following research areas:

·        
Development of Grid-Interactive Integrated Controls that provide
capability for the implementation of demand management strategies.

·        
Refinement or expansion of existing open-source building
management systems for use in indoor agriculture. DOE has funded research on
open-source building management-related systems such as BEMOSS™, VOLTTRON™, and
foresee™. These systems have focused solely on commercial and residential
applications and would need further refinement to adapt to the needs of CEA
facilities.

 

Preference will be given to those
applications that address multiple building end use systems including lighting,
ventilation, heating, air conditioning, humidity, and water, and plug and
process loads.

Note: In addition to the subtopics below, BETO is
considering proposals in response to Topic 11 - Joint Topic: Polymers Upcycling
and Recycling.

 

a.      Small
Business Bioenergy Technologies Increasing Community Partnerships 

This subtopic encourages
submission of innovative research proposals from bioenergy small businesses to
develop a community-scale preliminary design package of their products and/or
processes and engage community stakeholders to assess desirability and
feasibility of the small business’ proposed design.

 

Bioenergy feedstock development
and deployment can strengthen economic growth, national energy security, and
environmental benefits through optimizing domestic biomass resources to produce
biofuels, bioproducts, and biopower. Public perception and knowledge of
bioenergy is highly variable [1], so despite the benefits, local communities
may be unaware or uncertain about the available opportunities. Bioenergy small
businesses are uniquely positioned to develop community-scale technologies and
technological processes. Examples include small-scale solutions to recover
nutrients and energy from waste, such as urban food waste; use of energy crops
on marginal lands to manage fertilizer runoff; or use of algae to abate costs
of wastewater treatment. 

 

The preliminary design package
should include identification and siting of appropriate feedstock(s), lab-scale
testing of potential feedstock(s), relevant products (biofuel, bioproducts,
and/or biopower), outreach to potential community stakeholder partner(s), and
an education and outreach plan for the community, based on the bioenergy
project. 

 

Proposers are strongly encouraged
to develop partnerships with local stakeholders in underserved communities such
as those within Federally-designated Opportunity Zones [2]. Community
stakeholders could include schools, hospitals, local restaurants and other
businesses, non-profits, local government, or other local organizations. 
Applicants that propose partnerships with entities that operate at higher
levels, like state or regional, should emphasize how their project will deliver
measurable impact at the community level. 

 

Appropriate projects could
include, but are not limited to, a preliminary design package proposing:

·        
A conversion process treating local sources of biomass.

·        
Opportunities for use of the resulting product or products within
the community. 

·        
Cultivating energy crops to reduce fertilizer runoff to improve
local water quality.

·        
Integration of the small business’ technologies into
complementary, existing local infrastructure.

·        
Small business’ processes’ ability to meet local regulatory needs
(e.g., recycling rates or waste diversion goals).

·        
Replicability of the process in other communities.

 

Applications must:

·        
meaningfully include plans/methodology for local stakeholders’
input in the development of their preliminary design package.

·        
include an education and outreach plan to demonstrate the planned
benefits for the community.

 

Applications that propose the
following will not be considered for award under this subtopic:

·        
Use versions of technologies that already exist at the community
scale.

 

The main objective of a Phase I
award is developing a preliminary design package of their technology, product,
or process deployed at the community scale and derived from stakeholder input.
In Phase I the majority of research emphasis is placed on evaluating and
testing unknowns of integrating the technology at the community scale with
their specific stakeholder group(s) rather than on developing a new technology.
Some unknowns include technology performance parameters to better support the
local economy and public acceptance of the technology.  

 

Phase II of this topic involves
deployment of the proposed technology into the community at a pilot scale.

b.      Cultivating
a More Competitive Bioeconomy Through Strengthening Small Business Workforces


This
subtopic solicits proposals that pilot a research-driven workforce development
program or tool that can be widely applicable for the bioeconomy, establishing
a partnership with business experts in bioenergy and/or inclusive workforce
development.

 

Because biomass exists across
geographically diverse regions (i.e., agricultural crops, forestry residues,
Municipal Solid Waste, algae), people living in urban, suburban, and rural
areas across the country could all benefit from careers and opportunities in
the bioenergy industry. Increasing representation and inclusivity within the
bioenergy industry will support a more competitive domestic science and
engineering workforce to lead the way on innovation in the global economy [1].

 

The research project should
investigate questions related to the representation and inclusivity within the
business’ workplace in relation to technical and operational challenges that
could be inhibiting its commercial objectives in the bioeconomy. The overall
outcome is to create a workforce development program or tool through this
research that improves the commercialization potential of the business partner.
Ideally outcomes of this R&D are scalable mechanisms, platforms, and
technologies for increasing and improving diverse representation and equality
within the bioeconomy’s workforce. This could include, but is not limited to,
demonstrated success in increasing recruitment of trained professionals with
parallel skills from job sectors that have declined domestically, improving
workplace retention from underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math (STEM) and/or leadership positions; and correlating their
project with these improvements. 

 

Specific areas of interest under
this subtopic include, but are not limited to:

·        
Development of software to foster experiential learning mediated
by employer-educator partnerships that will ensure the alignment of bioenergy
curriculum with workplace demands. This software or technology should address
barriers associated with urban and rural areas as well as engaging people with
underrepresented backgrounds within bioenergy R&D and deployment.

·        
Research to identify gaps in workforce development, recruitment,
and retention within bioenergy fields of future workers/employees from
underrepresented backgrounds and implementation of a multi-year data-driven
program to address these gaps at the small business. The multi-year data-driven
program will provide a roadmap for other small businesses.

·        
Development of artificial intelligence or other data-driven
platforms that identify the impact of lacking or underdeveloped inclusive
operational and/or commercial practices on workforce development that, if
addressed, can improve business success and expansion. 

 

Applications must include a robust
evaluation plan to track and demonstrate the success of the workforce
development program proposed. 

 

Applications that propose the
following will not be considered for award under this subtopic:

·        
Development of traditional curricula or courses on bioenergy
topics.

·        
Conventional internship and training programs.

 

Phase I of this topic includes
completion of research and beta-testing of the workforce development program or
tool. Phase II includes the deployment of this technology at the bioeconomy
business and scaling the tool to other businesses.

rapid development of next-generation building technologies are vital to advance
building systems and components that are cost-competitive in the market, to
enable deep energy use reduction and lead to the creation of new business and
industries.

research completed under this effort will succeed in producing the predicted
performance advancement and reduction of technical risk required to move to
successive stages of research. The proposed Phase I effort should be designed
to retire significant technical risk and make proof of principle of the
proposed approach. Phase II may continue to develop the approach, but the
fundamental question of penultimate price and performance of the proposed
innovation should be well documented and clear in the Phase II proposal. 

 

NOTE: In addition to the subtopics below, BTO is considering
proposals in response to Topic 13 – Joint Topic: Advanced Building Construction
Technologies. BTO is also considering proposals in response to Topic 20 – Joint
Topic: CABLE Materials and Applications through subtopics (c) Non-metallic Heat
Exchangers, (d) Ice-storage and other thermal storage-related systems, and (e)
Electric Systems – Generators and Motors.

 

BTO seeks grant applications in the following subtopics:

 

a.      Remote
Building Data Collection Technologies for Virtual Audits and Inspections

This subtopic solicits innovative
approaches for leveraging remote sensing data collection and curation
techniques to automate the importing of building characteristic data into
existing virtual audit and inspection platforms.

 

Current conditions make
boots-on-the-ground audits difficult to execute, limiting the ability to
identify energy efficiency opportunities safely and cost-effectively through
audits and inspections. Recent advances in remote data collection make it
possible to evaluate building energy dynamics and opportunities for upgrades
using visual and thermal imagery. Remote sensing data, including visual
imagery and other sensor data types (such as infrared or other spectrums) can
be processed and leveraged for the pre-population of building characteristics
for use in existing building evaluation platforms. For more information on this
topic, applicants should refer to BTO’s building data science research,
resources, and tools website [1].

 

Approaches should leverage
standardized data systems, such as Audit Template, BuildingSync, HPXML, ASHRAE
223P, and other relevant management tools to synthesize and aggregate remote
sensing data for automated import into building energy evaluation tools.
Proposals should build upon existing tools to meet the requirements for a
remote audit or virtual building inspection and support further identification
of energy efficiency measure opportunities on a site by site basis with similar
results to traditional auditing techniques. BTO encourages applicants to
include identified sites in their proposals where the proposed outcome can be
tested and demonstrated in the field.

b.      Building
Energy Modeling

This subtopic solicits R&D
proposals for new methods, tools, applications for whole building energy
modeling (BEM) and closely related areas. BTO’s goal is to expand the effective
use of BEM in all use cases, supporting energy efficiency, demand flexibility,
or both.

 

Whole building energy modeling
(BEM) is a multi-purpose tool for building energy efficiency. At the individual
building project level, it supports optimized design of new and retrofitted
buildings and districts, HVAC equipment selection, sizing, and control design,
code-compliance, ratings and certificates, and incentives. BEM on prototypical
model supports the development of energy-efficiency codes, design guides,
incentive programs, and products. BEM also has some applications in building
operations. Although BEM typically implies physics-based modeling,
reduced-order, data-driven, and hybrid models have been demonstrated to be
sufficient for some applications and have both model development and execution
time advantages over physics-based models.

 

Proposals may target any BEM use
case (e.g., design, code-compliance, portfolio analysis), any sub-task
associated with one or more BEM use-cases (e.g., Building Information
Model-to-BEM, model input calibration, quality assurance), any building or
project type (e.g., new or existing, commercial or residential, individual
building or campus), and any approach (e.g., physics-based, data-driven,
hybrid). Although DOE funds the development of a number open-source
physics-based BEM tools and packages, use of DOE-funded BEM tools is not
required.  Applicants should explicitly state which existing tools (in whole or
in part) they will be using and which (if any) they plan to develop as part of
the proposed work.

 

Interested applicants may refer to
BTO’s draft research & development opportunities document for more
information about specific barriers to the effective adoption of BEM and
possible initiatives to address them [1].

c.       Solid-State
Lighting Technologies

This subtopic solicits R&D
proposals for innovative solutions in advanced solid-state lighting
technologies (SSL). There are three subtopic areas of interest for Lighting
R&D. Please note that awards may not be made in all areas, and the
distribution will depend on the number and quality of proposals received. In
all cases, project benefits should be demonstrated and validated as part of the
proposed project structure, and clear demonstration of product or technology
capabilities is required for consideration for advancement to Phase II funding.
For more information on these topics, applicants should refer to the Lighting
Research and Development Opportunities document [1].

 

1.      SSL
Technology development – DOE seeks product- and market-facing technology
development that achieves energy savings in addition to the 2019 baseline or
advanced functionality based on the features of SSL technology. Gains in energy
savings and new functionality can be achieved through optical delivery,
intensity controls, source and fixture efficiency, and spectral optimization.
Examples of product or technology advancement include energy savings in SSL applications
include, but are not limited to, general illumination, increased productivity,
enhanced well-being, safety improvements, and reduced environmental
impacts. 

2.      Manufacturing
Technologies and Materials for SSL –DOE seeks additive and sustainable manufacturing
techniques and materials for SSL for all portions of the value chain. These
techniques should enable manufacturing at scale for a wide variety of product
configurations with reduced component count, inventory, and production time
with potential for reduced cost. Also relevant are advancements in product
designs and materials that advance the capabilities of additive and/or
sustainable manufacturing without degrading performance or lifetime of
luminaries. Materials should reduce the embodied energy of the luminaire and
should be readily recycled, reused, or repurposed. This subtopic supports
DOE’s crosscutting emphasis to enable advancements in Advanced Manufacturing as
part of the Administration’s emphasis strengthening U.S. leadership in the
Industries of the Future; however, SBIR applicants for lighting-specific
manufacturing should apply to this topic.

3.      SSL
Material Science – DOE seeks research to advance understanding of SSL
degradation mechanisms, carrier dynamics, performance under different operating
regimes, photon generation and control, and downconverter properties. Research
should advance the understanding of material-performance relationships for SSL
technologies to enable energy saving and performance enhancement, in a way that
improves the technology’s commercial applications.  Application of
findings to novel device materials, SSL device architectures (including but not
limited to general illumination), or modeling software should be part of the
proposed project structure.

d.      Advanced
Building Control Systems for Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)

This subtopic solicits proposals
investigating innovative solutions for the refinement, integration, and
expansion of existing building management systems and tools for CEA
applications. Advanced building control systems for CEA, can be considered
analogous to building management systems, but customized for integration into
the unique processes and requirements of indoor farms. Current CEA control
systems may include some level of connectivity between equipment of moderate
efficiency and are intended to optimize the internal conditions for maximum
plant quality and growth. This limited amount of integration/connectivity with
other building management systems does not allow for smart decisions to be made
regarding how and when equipment should operate to optimize energy and water
costs, provide grid benefits while still maximizing plant quality and growth.
CEA is a rapidly expanding market and currently DOE estimates that these
technologies, when paired with high-efficiency integrated equipment, have the
potential to save 50-100 TBTu/yr in the U.S. For more information, applicants
should refer to the listed building automation system project pages [1, 2, 3].

 

Specifically, DOE is interested in
proposals in the following research areas:

·        
Development of Grid-Interactive Integrated Controls that provide
capability for the implementation of demand management strategies.

·        
Refinement or expansion of existing open-source building
management systems for use in indoor agriculture. DOE has funded research on
open-source building management-related systems such as BEMOSS™, VOLTTRON™, and
foresee™. These systems have focused solely on commercial and residential
applications and would need further refinement to adapt to the needs of CEA
facilities.

 

Preference will be given to those
applications that address multiple building end use systems including lighting,
ventilation, heating, air conditioning, humidity, and water, and plug and
process loads.

e.      Healthy
Efficient Buildings

This subtopic solicits proposals
for advanced technologies to enable healthy and efficient residential and
commercial buildings. There are two subtopic areas of interest for Healthy
Efficient Buildings. Note that awards may not be made in all areas, and the
distribution will depend on the number and quality of proposals received. In
all cases, project benefits should be demonstrated and validated as part of the
proposed project structure, and clear demonstration of product or technology
capabilities is required for consideration for advancement to Phase II funding.
For more information, applicants should refer to BTO’s Building America Program
Research-to-Market Plan [1].

 

1.     
Low-cost, Smart Ventilation Systems and Components for Healthy,
Efficient Residential Buildings- DOE seeks to identify and encourage
development of innovative ventilation system and/or component technologies with
the potential to improve IAQ and comfort in new and existing homes, with little
or no energy penalty and very low incremental cost to builders and contractors. 

 

Recent research and field-testing
by BTO and others have identified ventilation system technologies needed to
help the industry reliably achieve optimal indoor air quality (IAQ), comfort,
and energy efficiency in modern, “high performance” residential buildings.
Ventilation system performance, reliability, and cost continue to be barriers
to healthy, high performance homes, for both new construction and energy
retrofits. Furthermore, ventilation is recommended by ASHRAE as the first
building-related risk mitigation strategy for COVID-19.

 

Preference will be given to
technology solutions that are applicable to both new construction and the
existing building stock. While modest feasibility studies are appropriate for
Phase I funding, applications for these subtopics should be transitioning to
manufacturing by Phase II to be considered for further funding. BTO strongly
encourages applicants to include a strategy for obtaining manufacturing
partners by the end of Phase 1 as a part of their commercialization plan.

 

Specifically, DOE is interested in
the following IAQ and comfort control technology applications:

·        
Low-cost, reliable add-on sensors (e.g., flow sensors) and
controls for improved commissioning, operation, and maintenance of ventilation
systems.

·        
Smart ventilation/IAQ tools (sensors, controls, hardware,
software) that integrate with systems and components to optimize IAQ and
minimize energy penalties, based on indoor conditions (i.e., temperature, RH,
pollutant levels), outdoor conditions (i.e., temperature, RH, and/or pollutant
levels, including smoke), occupancy, and other variables such as weather
forecast data.

2.     
Health-Energy Nexus in Commercial Buildings- DOE seeks innovative
research, analysis, and development of building technologies and solutions that
improve building energy performance and maintain comfortable, healthy,
productive indoor environments despite disruptive events such as natural
disasters, the spread of infectious disease, and grid interruptions.

 

With disruptive events  such as
COVID-19, [2, 3] there is a need for research, analysis and the development of
resource efficient, resilient technologies and strategies to support the U.S.
building stock in managing healthy, efficient, and resilient buildings. 

 

Specifically, DOE is interested in
the following:

·        
Measuring, sensing, and evaluating the trade-offs associated with
indoor air quality, occupant comfort, health, and energy use in commercial
buildings.

·        
Research to better understand air transport in commercial
buildings, segmented by system type and/or sector under various conditions of
re-occupancy and ongoing operation as related to specified resilient scenarios.

·        
Development of novel efficient air-cleaning systems, advanced
filtration systems, and/or surface treatments.

9725f9c4323d5d3f86e8969db69e380f,16g,Agricultural Solar Systems,"g.      Agricultural
Solar Systems

This subtopic seeks proposals for
innovative technologies that can reduce the installed cost of streams from
agricultural solar systems, improve the systems’ energy yield, facilitate their
installation and grid interconnection, and enable additional value. Of
particular interest are new system designs and technologies that optimize solar
and agriculture production, which may include novel mounting and racking
designs or site configurations.

 

Although land requirements for
solar energy represent a small percentage of the country (92 GW of solar
estimated for 2030, which is estimated to require less than 0.1% of the land in
the contiguous United States), the growth in ground-mounted solar can create
competition with agricultural land for land use. Co-locating solar PV and
agriculture could provide diversified revenue sources and ecological benefits
for agricultural enterprises while reducing land-use competition and siting
restrictions. Except for growing pollinator habitat at solar facilities, the
co-location of solar and agriculture is primarily limited to research sites.
There are many opportunities to develop new technologies that enable
agricultural production (i.e., crop or livestock production, or pollinator
habitat) underneath or around solar energy systems that optimize both energy
and agricultural production at co-located sites [1].

 

Value streams of interest under
this subtopic include, but are not limited to, increased agricultural yield and
quality of life improvements, such as temperature reduction via shading.
Applicants must include a strategy for future work to validate additional
benefit/value streams, like crop field studies, for example.

a More Competitive Bioeconomy Through Strengthening Small Business Workforces


This
subtopic solicits proposals that pilot a research-driven workforce development
program or tool that can be widely applicable for the bioeconomy, establishing
a partnership with business experts in bioenergy and/or inclusive workforce
development.

 

Because biomass exists across
geographically diverse regions (i.e., agricultural crops, forestry residues,
Municipal Solid Waste, algae), people living in urban, suburban, and rural
areas across the country could all benefit from careers and opportunities in
the bioenergy industry. Increasing representation and inclusivity within the
bioenergy industry will support a more competitive domestic science and
engineering workforce to lead the way on innovation in the global economy [1].

 

The research project should
investigate questions related to the representation and inclusivity within the
business’ workplace in relation to technical and operational challenges that
could be inhibiting its commercial objectives in the bioeconomy. The overall
outcome is to create a workforce development program or tool through this
research that improves the commercialization potential of the business partner.
Ideally outcomes of this R&D are scalable mechanisms, platforms, and
technologies for increasing and improving diverse representation and equality
within the bioeconomy’s workforce. This could include, but is not limited to,
demonstrated success in increasing recruitment of trained professionals with
parallel skills from job sectors that have declined domestically, improving
workplace retention from underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math (STEM) and/or leadership positions; and correlating their
project with these improvements. 

 

Specific areas of interest under
this subtopic include, but are not limited to:

·        
Development of software to foster experiential learning mediated
by employer-educator partnerships that will ensure the alignment of bioenergy
curriculum with workplace demands. This software or technology should address
barriers associated with urban and rural areas as well as engaging people with
underrepresented backgrounds within bioenergy R&D and deployment.

·        
Research to identify gaps in workforce development, recruitment,
and retention within bioenergy fields of future workers/employees from
underrepresented backgrounds and implementation of a multi-year data-driven
program to address these gaps at the small business. The multi-year data-driven
program will provide a roadmap for other small businesses.

·        
Development of artificial intelligence or other data-driven
platforms that identify the impact of lacking or underdeveloped inclusive
operational and/or commercial practices on workforce development that, if
addressed, can improve business success and expansion. 

 

Applications must include a robust
evaluation plan to track and demonstrate the success of the workforce
development program proposed. 

 

Applications that propose the
following will not be considered for award under this subtopic:

·        
Development of traditional curricula or courses on bioenergy
topics.

·        
Conventional internship and training programs.

 

Phase I of this topic includes
completion of research and beta-testing of the workforce development program or
tool. Phase II includes the deployment of this technology at the bioeconomy
business and scaling the tool to other businesses.

Their mission is to provide America's farmers and ranchers with financial and technical assistance to voluntarily put conservation on the ground, not only helping the environment but agricultural operations, too. For more information regarding the agency and its programs visit http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/.   

NRCS's natural resources conservation programs help people reduce soil erosion, enhance water supplies, improve water quality, increase wildlife habitat, and reduce damages caused by floods and other natural disasters.  In order to implement these programs, landowners create a contract with NRCS to schedule implementation of these approved practices and then submit requests for reimbursement in accordance with the contract.  Currently, the NRCS offices are responsible for administering various conservation programs and entering into contracts with landowners for planned implementation.  Consequently, the NRCS requires contractor support to assist with the administrative and installation aspects of these contracts.  Tennessee NRCS does not have sufficient permanent resources to accomplish these tasks and is requiring the services of contractors to complete these activities. 

With the increase in conservation program assistance and contract administration provided by NRCS and administered by our Soil Conservationists, District Conservationists, Technical Specialists, and Administrative Specialists, there is a growing need for additional engineering support to allow for getting more conservation on the ground.  These positions, which are located in our Area Offices and Field Offices will provide additional engineering support to the existing engineering staff.

Tennessee NRCS wishes to establish a task order for this service and the task order will be for one (1) period of three (3) years and two (2) one (1) year option periods.

Only GSA schedule quotes will be accepted.  Only quotes from Woman Owned Small Businesses will be accepted for this requirement.

Both Small and OTS Offerors will be evaluated on the extent of participation of small business community (SBC) members in the performance of the acquisition.  Offerors are required to meet the minimum mandatory total small business participation objective/target of 20% of total acquisition value to SBC members.  Offerors proposing a higher objective/target of 20% may receive a more favorable evaluation. SBC members can propose work they will self-perform toward small business participation objectives. The small business subcontracting goals for this acquisition will be calculated based on the apparent successful Offeror(s)&rsquo; proposed small business participation objective (i.e. target percentage) of total acquisition value.



The Subcontracting Plan is NOT required with this submittal.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.7 and FAR Clause 52.219-9, if an other-than-small (i.e. &lsquo;large&rsquo;) business firm(s) is selected, it will be required to submit a detailed Subcontracting Plan.  Submission of such by the selected firm will be required with its price proposal, to be reviewed, negotiated and approved in parallel with the price negotiation (note that Subcontracting Plans are not required from SBCs).  The acceptable Subcontracting Plan will be incorporated into the basic IDC award, as a material part of the contract.  Minimum negotiated goals, progress and achievement will be monitored and evaluated through the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  If the contractor fails to comply in good faith with the approved plan, the Contracting Officer may take action in accordance with FAR 52.219-16 &lsquo;Liquidated Damages &ndash; Subcontracting Plan&rsquo;.  If the selected firm fails to negotiate a Subcontracting Plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer, then the offeror will be ineligible for award. 



Contract award is anticipated for July 2020.  To be eligible for contract award, the Contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).  Registration is free and can be accessed at: https://betaSAM.gov.  Ensure representations and certifications in SAM are current.

The information provided on the SF330s will be used to evaluate each Offeror&rsquo;s proposal.  The Government will evaluate the proposals in accordance with the criteria described herein, and award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Contract (IDIQ) contract to the responsible offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and who is deemed the most highly qualified.  Task orders will be negotiated against the IDIQ contract.  Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the factors contained in the following paragraphs. 



Specialized Experience/Past Performance.  Offerors will be evaluated on the following: 



The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will evaluate the relevancy of the submitted projects in comparison to the project description for this solicitation.  Projects that are determined to be very relevant will receive more consideration than projects that are considered to only be somewhat relevant.  The government will also evaluate how well the offeror performed on the projects that were submitted as evidence of specialized experience/past performance.  The Government reserves the right to check any or all cited references to verify supplied information and to assess owner satisfaction.  The Government also reserves the right to not contact the provided references.  In addition to the information submitted by the offeror, the Government reserves the right to review any other sources of relevant information for evaluating past performance, including projects other than those submitted by the offeror.  The Government will, at a minimum, review past performance information retrieved through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/Unique Entity Identifier numbers.  Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved from inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.



The Government will consider information in the Past Performance Questionnaires completed by personnel for whom the Offeror has performed work, and any information obtained from other sources.  Evaluation of specialized experience/past performance will be based on subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government&#39;s conclusions about the overall quality of the Offeror&#39;s past performance may influence the selection of the proposal.



Offerors may receive additional consideration if they have successfully completed previous design experience work with either the USDA or the USACE.  Offerors may also receive additional consideration for professionals identified in Section E. that have worked previously on any of the submitted projects from Section F.  Offerors that demonstrate experience with planning and/or design charrettes, especially on projects that involve scientific research or construction project in a University setting may receive additional consideration.



NOTE:  For purposes of evaluating past performance, the Prime Contractor is defined as the contractor identified in Part I - Contract-Specification Qualifications, Section C. Proposed Team of the SF330.



Design Quality Management Plan. Offerors will be evaluated on the following:



Design Quality Management Plan narratives will be evaluated based on the level of understanding of the design process and the involvement the lead designers will have in the management, oversight, control, and coordination of the design work performed during the design of the project. Narratives that demonstrate a clear understanding of the design process involved in agricultural research facilities and provide a thorough approach for successfully managing the specialized requirements for agricultural research facilities may receive additional consideration by the SSEB.  The offeror&rsquo;s organizational chart will be evaluated based on the clarity, adequacy, and capabilities for successfully managing the solicited project.



Evaluation Process



The SSEB will be comprised of representatives of the Corps of Engineers, User/Customer, and other required personnel.  Offerors are advised that the evaluation and rating of proposals will be conducted in strict confidence.  Reviews of non-price factors will be conducted prior to any rates or pricing being submitted.  The number and identities of offerors will not be revealed to anyone who is not involved in the evaluation and award process or to other offerors.

8f9de0ce26704268a51f4b5e9c661dde,996925NEA,Contractor support in scientific applications to support and conduct research supporting projects in earth system science and crop modeling applications.,"The Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Northeastern Area (NEA), Beltsville Area Research Center (BARC), Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory (HRSL) and Adaptive Cropping Systems Laboratory (ACSL) requires contractor support in scientific applications for several projects supporting earth system science and applications.

This acquisition is to support scientific research project needs of the two laboratories as indicated above.  This contract needs to provide up to 4 full-time 40-hour work-week professional scientific labor positions per year.  Positions are designated as either Senior Engineer, Senior Scientist, or Scientist based on scientific degree (i.e. Ph.D., or M.S.) and documented experience as related to projects defined in task orders. Categories include expertise in Earth Science, Crop Modeling, and Information Technology / Software Development in Agricultural Systems.

Specific purposes and objectives are subdivided by two laboratories as indicated below :

HRSL is tasked with developing new approaches for measuring water cycle components within agricultural landscapes.  A variety of techniques can be utilized for making these measurements. For instance, ground-based sensors are used to measure rainfall accumulation and the amount of water moving within a stream channel.  Water balance models are used to convert rainfall measurements into estimates of soil moisture, evaporation and stream flow.  Observations made by satellites orbiting the earth can be converted into estimates of soil moisture or evaporation from the land surface.  Finally, each of these different techniques can be combined together. For example, remote sensing observations can be integrated into a land surface model to improve the accuracy of their predictions (a technique commonly referred to as &ldquo;data assimilation.&rdquo;) Applying each of these techniques requires the application of state-of-the-art data management and processing approaches to obtain sufficiently accurate estimates of various water balance components.  In addition, water balance component estimates must be validated against independently-acquired observations before they can be used with confidence.  Establishing the relevance of soil moisture estimates for monitoring agricultural production and informing drought mitigation is also a priority. 

ACSL is tasked with obtaining empirical knowledge of crop system responses to soil, climate, management factors and developing mathematical models that can be used to study agricultural cropping systems resiliency. Over 20 years of U.S. commodity crop yield, growth, and development responses to multiple experimental treatment conditions has been developed by the laboratory.  Computerized methods to store and perform data-mining operations on this unique set of information need to be developed to test and improve existing mechanistic, process-level crop and soil models that are being constructed in the laboratory. Graphical user interface software, along with database management approaches, need to be developed to further increase the usefulness of these modeling tools for stakeholders. This can include desktop and web-based software development. Annual experiments are also conducted in state-of-the-art growth chamber systems that require development and maintenance real-time software tools to monitor and record data collected at 30 second intervals. A substantial need for a computer scientist / programmer therefore exists to ensure quality and improve scientific impact and quality of ACSL data and model products.
