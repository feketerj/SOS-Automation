The aircraft are currently based at 3 Continental United States (CONUS) and 17 Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations (see below). The C-12 mission is to provide time-sensitive movement of personnel and cargo and provide test support. The Government is the holder of all Technical Data.

NOTE: There are only five (5) military bases that host the C-12 aircraft. The remaining sites are either at foreign military bases or commercial facilities.  

The scope of this effort includes all support actions required for operating and maintaining the aircraft, aircraft subsystems, and support equipment.  The CLS system includes all aircraft maintenance and personnel, materials and inspections, launch and recovery of the aircraft, supply of all Contractor owned spares and support equipment through a Contractor Operated and Maintained Parts (COMP); repair and overhaul of all repairable spares at Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified repair stations; maintenance and repair of all support equipment; aircraft paint; engine repair and overhaul. These actions include supply, procurement, production control, quality control, component failure reports, and acquisition of commercial data.  This effort includes additional support, as over and above tasks, engineering services including development, test and FAA certification of modifications, and installation of modifications, depot maintenance support, field team support (worldwide), aircraft crash investigations, and damage repair.  Contractor is required to establish and maintain agreements with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for data and technical support to maintain the C-12 aircraft.  The Government also requires information for: quality, contract funds status, consumption and usage, service engineering reports, subscription services for technical manual updates and service actions.

The Contractor will be responsible for the spares that support all systems for the C-12 aircraft. The Government will provide a small amount of spares in support of the fleet. A small number of C-12 aircraft are equipped with a defensive system.

b98251f1e0734f1aa5da500738a73abf,NM-AN2200-23-01255,AOC Tire Cart,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Marine and Aviation Operations/Marine Operations Center The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aircraft Operation Center (AOC) owns and operates four different Type, Model, Series (T/M/S) aircraft including the Lockheed Martin WP-3D Orion, the Beechcraft King Air 350C, the DHC-6 Twin Otter, and Gulfstream G-IV. Each aircraft undergoes periodic scheduled and unscheduled maintenance that requires specific tools, parts, and test equipment. As a result, an efficient, safe, and non-damaging mode of transportation for heavy aircraft equipment is critical for maintenance operations.



(II)       This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NM-AN2200-23-01255, NAME: AOC Tire Cart



(III)      The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2023-02.



(IV)      This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,250 Employees. 



(V)       This specification contains requirements for



A dedicated aviation tire service cart, capable of bearing heavy aircraft equipment, is required to transport tire and wheel assemblies, servicing equipment, and maintenance tools from the aviation warehouse to the hangar. Agency needs include: a cart narrow enough to navigate confined spaces, a high load bearing capacity, and large enough to haul all required equipment in a single trip. A towable service cart will decrease maintenance turnaround times by providing a rapid and functional method of transportation for historically person-carried items. While multiple pieces of equipment can be hauled at a time, maintenance personnel can shift focus to actions on the aircraft instead of relocation of parts.

Throughout hurricane season, the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) advertises mission response actions within a 24 hour period, better known as alert 24. Efficient maintenance practices help to ensure that NOAA aircraft are returned to service with minimal down time. While NOAA&rsquo;s heavy aircraft will derive the greatest benefit, all T/M/S aircraft at AOC will be positively affected by the purchase of a tire service cart. As hurricane season 2023 rapidly approaches, it is recommended to prioritize this purchase for immediate use.

Requirements 

An efficient mode of transportation for aircraft tires, equipment, and tools.

Towable and maneuverable in confined hangar spaces.

Load bearing capacity to hold WP-3D tires and wheel components.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program



It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) CONTRACT LANGUAGE

NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)


	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:



	
	
		Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.
	
	



	
	
		Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.
	
	



	
	
		Identify constraints in transparency and process.
	
	



	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.



	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer&#39;s decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.



	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman&#39;s authority, for instance:



	
	
		Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.
	
	


                       The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.


	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA&#39;s agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).
	
	



	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.



	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.



	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.

DISCLAIMER

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The contractor shall modify the avionics for six (6) Beechcraft King Air 1900C Aircraft. These aircraft have had post-production modifications installed which must be preserved in the avionics modification. These post-production modifications include the AeroData Flight Inspection System (AFIS-113) and the Lica Electro Optical System (ADS-80).

2. ELIGIBILITY: All responses shall address the following:

a. Business Size per NAICS 336413 and Classification Code 1680.

b. Identify POC including phone and email address.

c. Identify if your firm will provide Aircraft Components, Spares, and Accessories for a King Air 1900C Aircraft.

d. Provided documentation supporting the General Requirements as outlined in this announcement.

e. Delivery Date after contract award.

f. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate which shall assume the EAF will deliver the aircraft to the location in Europe where the modification shall take place and take delivery of the aircraft at the same location.

g. Provide name of Integrator at European location, if not your company.

3. REQUIRED CAPABILITIES: The information described below will also be required to fulfill this procurement.

a. The supplier must replace existing avionics with avionics which will allow the Egyptian Air Force (EAF) to fly in civil airspace under instrument flight rules (IFR) without the need for a host country waiver due to lack of avionics capabilities required for entry into that airspace.

b. The airspace of intended EAF aircraft operations includes Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia, and overwater airspace controlled under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations.

c. These EAF aircraft will not fly above Flight Level 290 (29,000&rsquo;) so avionics equipage requirements above those altitudes need not be met.

d. Modifications shall be certified for airworthiness by either the FAA or EASA regulations.

4. NEW AVIONICS SUITE: The new avionics suite must accommodate requirements listed below which are grouped into threshold and objective categories. Threshold requirements are those which are mandated in order to fly in the desired civil airspace under IFR and must be addressed by the supplier in their response. Objective requirements are those which will make flight either more efficient or increase the effectiveness or safety of the fight crew, do not have to be met by the supplier&rsquo;s response, but may be offered if desired. After each requirement, a rationale is provided to explain what the requirement demands and explains the consequences of not having it.

4.1 Threshold Requirements:

 a. VHF Communication Radios: Very High Frequency, Amplitude Modulated (VHF-AM) communications radios in the frequency range of 118.0-136.0 MHz for communications with air traffic control (ATC). The frequency spacing for this range of operations shall be selectable between 25 kHz and 8.33 kHz spacing. Two such radios are required on every aircraft for redundancy.

Rationale: Eurocontrol now requires aircraft to communicate within Europe on ATC frequencies which are spaced 8.33 kHz from each other. This is to enable more frequencies to be available within the 118-136 MHz range. Outside of Europe, the required frequency spacing is 25 kHz.

b. HF Communications Radios: High Frequency (HF) communications radio in the frequency range of 3.0 to 30.0 MHz for communications with ATC in remote areas such as oceanic routes or routes which are beyond the range of VHF communications. Control of the HF Radio system is to be fully integrated with the display system with no standalone controller.

Rationale: Flying in remote airspace outside the range of radar and VHF communication makes air traffic control difficult. ATC needs position reports from the flight crews periodically so they can provide advisories to deconflict traffic. HF radio is one of the oldest methods for providing Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communication, though it is not as effective as satellite communications. Even aircraft with Satellite communication for ATC are required to have an HF radio as a backup.

c. Transponder with EHS and ADS-B: Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance &ndash; Broadcast (ADS-B) capable transponders capable of meeting the European Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 1207/2011 which calls out the detailed performance requirements of the data transponders are required to transmit to ATC.

Rationale: Eurocontrol now mandates aircraft to equip and utilize transponders which automatically transmit a variety of digital data derived from the aircraft avionics. This data pertains to the aircraft&rsquo;s identification, location, altitude, velocities, flight status, and intentions. Some of this data is coded only once in the transponder, some data varies with each flight depending on conditions, and some data is constantly changing. The constantly changing data must be acquired from other aircraft systems such as GPS, Air Data Computer, weight on wheels sensors and other avionics.

d. ILS with FM Immunity: Europe requires that VHF navigation systems which provide VHF Omni Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) capabilities must be designed with Frequency Modulation (FM) Immunity to protect against interference from commercial VHF FM radio stations. These systems operate in the range from 108-118 MHz with the glide slope receivers operating in the UHF band.

Rationale: Europe is a densely populated continent and the number of commercial FM radio broadcast has utilized most all of the allowable VHF FM frequency spectrum from 87.0-108 MHz. Radio stations broadcasting at the upper end of this spectrum may produce signals which would interfere with an aircraft&rsquo;s ability to properly receive an ILS localizer signal on the lower end of the VHF navigation band above 108 MHz. FM Immunity is not an enhanced or additional capability, but a means of preserving an existing ILS localizer capability in the presence of commercial FM radio signals to prevent interference.

e. GNSS Enabled with SBAS: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the American Global Positioning System (GPS) or the European Galileo System, determine the aircraft&rsquo;s position and velocity around the world to a high degree of accuracy utilizing signals broadcast from a constellation of medium earth orbit satellites. 

Rationale: Terrestrial based navigational aids, such as VOR and NDB, are rapidly being decommissioned worldwide in favor of satellite based GNSS navigation. The requirements for ADS-B transponders in Europe and the United States imposes an additional requirement for GNSS equipment to provide upgraded performance and availability which may only be possible using GNSS with Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). SBAS systems, such as WAAS in North America and EGNOS in Europe and North Africa, augment basic GNSS signals with timing corrections measured on the ground in certain regions, uplinked to Geostationary Satellites, then downlinked to aircraft in flight to cancel most of the error in GNSS calculations providing a more accurate position and velocity determination. The addition of the geostationary SBAS satellite to the constellation also provides a higher degree of availability and error alerting.

f. TCAS Version 7.1: Traffic and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) {also known in Europe as Aircraft Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS)} work with the aircraft transponder to alert the flight crew to the presence of air traffic which is close enough to pose a mid-air collision hazard. 

Rationale: Europe is the only region in the world which requires TCAS Version 7.1 standard verses Version 7.0 that is all which is required in the rest of the world. The difference between 7.1 and 7.0 is a slight difference in the Resolution Advisories (RA) which are audibly transmitted to the crew via the intercom. The Version 7.1 standard is required by European Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 1332/2011.

g. Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS): TAWS systems alert aircrews when they are flying too close to the ground in order to help prevent Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) accidents. These systems sense the aircraft altitude in relation to the surrounding terrain elevation based on the aircraft position and a database of terrain elevation. When the aircraft flies into an area of rising terrain and the difference between the aircraft&rsquo;s current altitude and the terrain elevation is below an allowable tolerance, the system issues verbal warnings to the flight crew to take corrective action. The TAWS function shall be fully integrated with avionics system to reduce total system weight.

Rationale: Aircraft which carry more than six passengers are required to be equipped with a TAWS system in the US and Europe.

h. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR):  Aircraft which carry more than 19 passengers must be equipped with a CVR and FDR. CVR and FDR must be housed in a crash survivable housing and they may be combined into a single unit. For overwater flights, the CVR and/or FDR must also be equipped with and underwater locator beacon (ULB) which is capable of transmitting for 90 days after a water crash.

Rationale: A CVR and FDR are required to record the flight crew&rsquo;s voice and pertinent airplane data to aid in post-crash accident investigations.

i. ARC-210 Multiband Radio: Two of the six aircraft already have two ARC-210 radios installed and the EAF would like the other four aircraft equipped with similar capability. The model of ARC-210 installed, 629F-12A, are export variants.

Rationale: Customer requested.

j. Stormscope: Some aircraft are equipped with WX 500 stormscope. Avionics system will be capable of displaying as required stormscope data.

Rationale: Aircraft that currently have this capability utilize this to augment active weather radar information for increased convective activity situational awareness.

k. Cursor Control Device: The avionics system shall utilize a cursor control device for display management and data entry.

Rationale: Much of the flight environment and envelope is conduct in unstable and turbulent air. Data entry must be reliable and consistent to maintain low flight crew work load. A cursor control device allows a solid anchor point for entry of data by flight crew

4.2 Objective Requirements:

a. New Autopilot: The autopilot on these aircraft is old and may be in danger of component obsolescence.

Rationale: While there is no requirement for autopilot imposed by civil aviation authorities outside of RVSM airspace, autopilots are a tremendous workload reducer for the flight crews. Older autopilots may lack some features found in new autopilot which enable it to work more seamlessly with newer navigation system to enable fully coupled IFR approaches.

b. Glass Cockpit: A glass cockpit is composed of multiple electronic LCD display screens which present aircraft instrumentation and navigation information to the flight crew in an easier to read manner.

Rationale: Older instrument panels are populated with a variety of instrumentation scattered across the panel. The overall reliability of the instrumentation is somewhat less than that of a glass cockpit due to the reduced number of components and increase reliability of the newer LCD displays over older instrumentation. Glass cockpits lend themselves to upgrades via software updates making modifications somewhat easier compared to older, analog instrumentation installations where instruments and warning lights would have to be physically relocated on the panel. Some new navigation capabilities like moving map displays are not possible without electronic displays.

c. Selective Calling (SELCAL): SELCAL is a feature of HF radio which alerts the pilot to an incoming call from ATC. It is not an ATC requirement.

Rationale: When navigating over long distances, flight crews have to monitor the HF radio audio for any calls from ATC directed to their aircraft. This requires the crew to listen to hours of radio static to monitor ATC for these calls. A SELCAL box allow the flight crew to not have to listen to this static. When a call from ATC goes out to our specific aircraft tail number, the SELCAL box alerts the crew to the presence of an incoming HF radio call so the crew can answer without having to monitor the on-frequency radio static for all that time when there is no call.

d. Satellite Communications (SATCOM): Satcom is a BLOS communication system for ATC which has superior audio quality to HF radio. ATC requires some form of BLOS communications when flying in remote areas beyond VHF range. HF is acceptable, but SATCOM is generally preferred.

Rationale: SATCOM provides better audio quality compared to HF. SATCOM requires a subscription to a service provider which can be quite expensive. The same hardware which enables BLOS coms with ATC can also be used to provide the cabin passengers with satellite telephone service as well as digital communication to access e-mail and other internet services. 

e. Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV): LPV is a Flight Management System (FMS) capability which requires an SBAS enabled GNSS system to provide ILS like guidance to an airport which has no ILS system installed.

Rationale: The terrestrial portion of ILS systems are expensive. A single ILS to one runway can cost as much as $1M and it requires constant monitoring and periodic maintenance. Consequently, they are only installed at the biggest and busiest airports. An aircraft with an SBAS enabled GNSS, such as WAAS GPS, EGNOS GPS, or EGNOS Galileo, has the positional accuracy and reliability to execute ILS like approaches to ILS like minimums to airfields with no terrestrial navigational aids installed. This reduces the cost to the air navigation service provider and enables approaches to low minimums to small airfields at greatly reduced costs. An airfield would have to have a charted approach to take advantage of this technology and the approach would have to be included on the non-corruptible database installed in the FMS. Currently, only airfields in the US, Canada, and Europe offer this capability thanks to WAAS and EGNOS. The service volume of EGNOS includes Northern Africa, but unless an airfield has a charted approach to LPV minimums, the capability cannot be used.

f. Controller Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC): CPDLC is essentially text messaging between the flight crew and ATC. CPDLC is enabled by a communications manager and either a VHF radio or Satellite radio. Digital message are composed and received on a display panel in the cockpit which is usually the FMS. Eurocontrol Mandates this service for aircraft which fly above FL290, but it is not required by aircraft which fly below FL 290. Equipping for CPDLC requires the aircraft&rsquo;s Cockpit Voice Recorder record the digital communications in addition to the voice communications.

Rationale: Congested airspace such as that which exists in Europe makes placing and receiving radio calls to ATC difficult at times. There is a limited number of VHF frequencies available for voice communications for ATC so the volume of traffic on each frequency can be quite large. CPDLC allows the transmission and reception of digital message over the same frequencies and enable messages to be targeted to specific recipients. This reduces the amount of voice traffic on frequency and provides ATC instructions in written form which prevents the need to &ldquo;Say Again&rdquo; when the message is not completely understood. This is especially true for communications between pilots and controllers for which English is not their first language. Pilots and controllers may have an unusual, or difficult to understand accent when speaking English which is the required language for air traffic control.  Although use of CPDLC is not mandated below FL290, it is available which may make pilot to controller communications more clear and efficient.

5. WARRANTIES: Supply warranties with start and expiration dates for parts that require warranties.

558be02c7b6f46ce8379e1e70991d533,RFI-01-FWPOTA ,U.S.  Army Fixed Wing (FW) Project Office (PO) is seeking information regarding services to provide worldwide support to the Army's fixed wing fleet of Transport Aircraft.,"THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY &ndash; This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes &ndash; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Respondents shall not be obligated to provide the services described herein. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on https://beta.sam.gov/. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.



The Army Fixed Wing (FW) Project Office (PO) is seeking information regarding services to provide worldwide support to the Army&#39;s fixed wing fleet of Transport Aircraft. These services include programmatic, business, technical, and logistical functional support to the fleet. There is no solicitation package available at this time. Since 1974, Army fixed wing aircraft have consisted primarily of commercial derivative aircraft (CDA) that have been militarized in support of unit and customer missions during peacetime, contingency operations, and time of war such as operational support airlift (personnel and limited cargo) and priority air transport (Department of Defense (DoD) and other agency senior leadership). A CDA, as defined by the FW PO, is an aircraft procured by the armed services for which there is a commercial aircraft equivalent that is Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-type certified, (i.e., an off-the-shelf non-developmental item), and that has its serial number listed on an FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet. The Army Transport Aircraft (TA) CDA systems currently in use for transport missions include Beechcraft, Cessna, Fairchild Swearingen and Textron Defense lines of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products and are classified as small in accordance with (IAW) the Army and FAA weight classes. The Government may add other types of TA CDA and Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) systems during the contract performance period; however, the current number of TA aircraft supported is 154. The total number of aircraft the contractor supports may fluctuate during the period of performance resulting in a total increase or decrease by up to 15%. These aircraft are classified IAW the Army and FAA weight classes. The average range of cost over the last three years is between $135 million - $155 million.

	NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)


The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:


	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.
	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.
	Identify constraints in transparency and process.





	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.





	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer&rsquo;s decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.





	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman&rsquo;s authority, for instance:





	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).
	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.
	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.
	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA&rsquo;s agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).



	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.
	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.

420995b5fb12482898ac12862d374aec,2020MINOTAUR,Minotaur Rapid Reaction and Prototyping Engineering Support,"Notice of Intent to Sole Source:

This acquisition will be in support of Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Aviation, Maritime, and Border Technologies Contracting Division (AMBTCD).  CBP intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Contract for the procurement of Minotaur Rapid Reaction and Prototyping Engineering Support into a contract on a sole source basis to John Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL).

The Minotaur Mission Processor software (MMS) provides integrated capabilities for building, disseminating, and exploiting real-time tactical all-source overland and maritime Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) information through an enterprise. 

The MMS has been managed by the Navy and Air and Marine Office since 2008; originally called the Ocean Surveillance System (OSI). MMS was chosen to be AMOs multi-sensor exploitation system in 2013.  The MMS integrates airborne sensors and distributes data to the Air and Marine Operations Center and Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF-S). MMS provides in-flight and post-mission synchronized data from one or more assets. MMS is operational on the following platforms:


	MQ 9 Predator (VADER) and Guardian (Raytheon SeaVue)
	P3 Long Ranger Tracker (Raytheon SeaVue)
	DHC8 (Raytheon SeaVue)
	B200 Mongoose
	Beechcraft 350ER Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft (MEA) (Selex Sea Spray)
	 


The services to be acquired are for Systems Engineering and Technology Evaluations to include intensive assessment of system capabilities to adapt and upgrade the current Minotaur Mission Processor software baseline for overland and maritime operations. The improved system capabilities will allow for the continuation of critical services to support the timely implementation and retrofit activities to install the Minotaur Mission Processor and its associated software baseline onto manned and unmanned Air and Marine Operations (AMO) aircraft; providing each aircraft with overland and maritime surveillance capabilities.  The required tasks to accomplish this effort are as follows:

Task 1: Adapt and Upgrade Minotaur Mission Processor. JHU/APL shall adapt and upgrade the current Minotaur Mission Processor software baseline for overland and maritime operations with all AMO aircraft and ground C2 centers.

Task 2: Retrofit or Install Minotaur Mission Processor Aboard CBP Aircraft. JHU/APL shall retrofit or install the Minotaur Mission Processor and its associated software baseline onto manned and unmanned AMO aircraft, providing each aircraft with overland and maritime surveillance capabilities (dependent upon specific sensor capabilities and limitations).

Task 3: Retrofit or Install Minotaur Mission Processor at Ground C2 Centers. JHU/APL shall retrofit or install the Minotaur Mission processor and associated software baseline into selected ground C2 centers. 

Task 4: Investigate New or Promising ISR Capabilities. JHU/APL shall investigate the implementation, integration, and/or improvement of new or promising ISR technologies and capabilities that could significantly enhance CBP&rsquo;s overland and maritime surveillance operations. 

Task 5: Training Support for Minotaur Mission Processor. Training class at JHU/APL facilities (or possibly at a different location at AMO discretion) to instruct a small number of personnel designated by AMO, who will, in turn, train all other AMO operators.

IntroductionThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA.  Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA's prioritized airborne requirements.
PurposeThe purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about the capability and availability of purchasing one (1) multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft, with necessary modifications, to replace NOAA/AOC's Gulfstream Turbo Commander, AC695A aircraft, with the option to purchase a second multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft to support NOAA/OMAO's national mission.  The purchased aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's King Air 350CER (serial number FM21) for safety and standardization.
BackgroundThe aircraft of the NOAA/AOC are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's environment.  NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around the world over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic pack ice.  These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data essential to their research.
The AOC provides capable, mission-ready aircraft and professional crews to the scientific community wherever and whenever they are required. Whether studying global climate change or acid rain, assessing marine mammal populations, surveying coastal erosion, investigating oil spills, or improving hurricane prediction models, the AOC flight crews continue to operate in some of the world's most demanding flight regimes.
The AOC operates and maintains a Gulfstream Turbo Commander (AC695A, serial number 96089), a highly modified twin turboprop aircraft, supporting NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NWS works to provide weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enchantment of the national economy.  Manufactured in 1984, the airframe is over 30 years old and due to aging costs, standardization issues, and loss of mission readiness, OMAO is seeking to replace this aircraft.
The AOC also operates and maintains a Hawker-Beechcraft King Air 350CER (B300C, serial number FM21), another highly modified twin-turboprop aircraft that was acquired in 2007 (WC133M07CN0231), supporting NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NOS works to observe, understand, and manage our Nation's coastal and marine resources. NOS measures and predicts coastal and ocean phenomena, protects large areas of the oceans, works to ensure safe navigation, and provides tools and information to protect and restore coastal and marine resources.   NOAA's requirements have grown over the past ten (10) years and a single aviation platform cannot support all the flight hours that NOS requests every year.  Additionally, this aircraft serves as a single point of failure for the collection of rapid response damage assessment following storms that impact the United States and its territories and the requirement for a backup aircraft exists for the Nation.  For these reasons, OMAO is seeking to expand its fleet of aircraft.
AOC is replacing the Turbo Commander with a multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft(s) capable of efficiently flying the profiles required by NWS and the other line offices in NOAA.   AOC is also contemplating expanding its fleet and capabilities by acquiring an additional King Air 350.The prospective aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's existing King Air 350CER, serial number FM21, for safety and standardization.  This Sources Sought / RFI is issued to gage industry interest as well as aircraft availability for this requirement.

e2ad02d37d1524776770d52098ec532c,FA8617-17-C-6211,Joint Primary Aircraft Training System Post Production Sustaining Engineering and Program Management Services,"Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Training Aircraft Division, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for up to fifty (50) months of Post Production Sustaining Engineering and Program Management (SEPM) services to Beechcraft Defense Company (BDC), LLC, 201 S. Greenwich, Wichita, KS 67207-1402. Market research was conducted and it has been determined this effort is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.The Post Production SEPM contract will provide program management and engineering services to support the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) fleet of 744 T-6 A/B/D aircraft at nine (9) locations for up to fifty (50) months. The JPATS users include United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), and United States Army (USA) and foreign customers participating in JPATS Foreign Military Sales (FMS). SEPM services include but are not limited to: systems engineering support, program management support, integrated logistics support, field service representative support, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Sources (DMSMS) management, study and analysis of aircraft deficiencies, as needed operation of a depot-level aircraft modification line, contractor field team activities, aircraft crash damage repair, individual aircraft tracking, aircraft structural integrity and engine structural integrity efforts, configuration and data management, technical manual updates, and design, development, testing, and supplemental military or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification of engineering changes necessary to correct component deficiencies or to introduce product enhancements into the aircraft fleets via retrofit. The contractor will also provide required FAA serviceability documentation and management of Government Furnished Property (GFP) supplied during the performance of this contract.BDC, as the OEM, provides highly specialized support as they own the T-6 engineering data and drawings. BDC designed and developed the T-6 platform and is the only source for all historical and current proprietary data, such as: developmental design and approval data, prototype data, and qualification and test data. These data are required to perform the sustaining engineering function for the T-6 program including damage assessment, occasional prototype of the repair, and development of repair instructions, when the extent of damage is unknown and/or needed repairs are non-standard. As ascertained through market research, other companies did not define a methodology that allowed them to obtain/recreate the engineering data necessary to support the program. The breadth of these data would include engineering drawings, stress analyses, durability and damage tolerance analysis, thermal and electrical margins, or other required documentation. BDC's refusal to sell/lease data combined with other sources lack of mitigation strategies to obtain the technical data required to perform the specifications contained herein would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.Additionally, BDC owns the FAA type certificate on the T-6 aircraft. Their responsibilities as the type certificate owner include supporting the aircraft in the field by supplying parts and engineering services. The T-6 Program Office must have a relationship with BDC based on continued operation of the fleet. If someone other than BDC was to attempt to perform SEPM services that organization would need to have access to BDC data for repairs outside of the Structural Repair Manual, ADs, SBs, etc.A sole source award for more than one year is required to ensure there is no interruption in critical sustaining engineering services and program management support. If support services are interrupted, there will be a break in the training pipeline of pilots for the USAF and USN, severely impacting the ability of those services to provide required trained pilots into the mobility and combat aircraft pilot training pipelines. USA test and evaluation activities would be equally impacted if engineering services necessary to keep the T-6D aircraft in the air were suddenly removed.This is a notice of intent, not a solicitation.

36f55d6d3675d69760825285ab17ee09,24810,MARKET SURVEY:  Rockwell-Collins Integration of ACSS Transponder in ProLine 21 Equipped BE-300 Aircraft,"NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

This is a market survey for the immediate acquisition of non-recurring engineering support services and software required to integrate an ACSS Model NXT-800 transponder into the ProLine 21 equipped King Air (Be-300).  

The FAA Flight Inspection Be-300 fleet of aircraft is in the process of having the Rockwell-Collins, ProLine 21 Avionics Suite of equipment installed.  The FAA is contemplating a fixed-price contract to include the following line items for this requirement.  

Line Item 0001:  Non-recurring engineering â€“ this includes completion of the Critical Design Review; research, development, identification of functional communication signals, and documentation of these parameters and requirements to ensure functionality and that these components properly communicate through the Control Display Unit (CDU).  This information/display information will be integrated between all the various components to make sure the system will have the ability to capture and process the signals and broadcast the correct ADS-B information to ground based receivers.

Line Item 0002:  CDU-3000 Service Bulletin for 822-0882-267  to -495 (2 per aircraft) for a total of 34 each

Line Item 0003:  IOT-4110 Software (RCPN 810-0053-XXX) (2 per aircraft) for a total of 34 each

Line Item 0004:  MDT-3110 Software (RCPN-810-0042-XXX) for a total of 17

This equipment is proprietary to Rockwell-Collins under Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA01267WI-D.  Rockwell-Collins owns the patents, proprietary data and software applicable to all equipment, components, software, and data required for installation of this proprietary avionics system.  This equipment is required to interface with the Flight Inspection System Equipment AFIS and FIAPA used in the backend of the aircraft to test the navigation system of the National Airspace.  

The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Rockwell-Collins as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and is the only known source that owns the rights to modify its equipment and systems.  The FAA requires the engineering expertise that Rockwell-Collins provides that includes information and data necessary to trouble shoot, analyze, test, identify and determine risk of various anomalies in addition to making necessary corrections to their equipment and/or systems software.  As the OEM, Rockwell-Collins owns the STC to add avionics functionality in the Hawker Beechcraft Models B300/B300c.  Due to the non-recurring engineering effort, this specific effort excludes any Rockwell â€“ Collins third party dealers from meeting this requirement.

Responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this market survey. Therefore any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendorâ€™s expense.   

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all businesses that are interested in and capable of meeting all line item requirements as noted above.

 25 May 2016  Request for Information -- T-1 COMBS Follow-On
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  This Request for Information (RFI) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive and/or a Small Business Set-Aside.  This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research.  No funds are available to fund the information solicited. 
The AFLCMC/WLZW T-1A office at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) for 178 T-1A aircraft, beginning in FY18, at five (5) CONUS locations.  The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an additional Industry Day and/or Pre-solicitation Conference.  The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No qualification requirements or Technical Orders exist.  Consequently, potential sources for this effort typically would be companies who have a license or agreement with the Original Equipment Manufacturer Beechcraft Defense Corporation, Cage 70898 to complete the work described, including military specific modifications.
The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 488190, size standard $32.5 mil.  The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a)s, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code.  Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.  Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime, and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.
The following scenario is for research purposes only and your candid answers will aid our strategy planning for the T-1A COMBS acquisition.   All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with responses to the following questions and any comments or questions to the Contracting Officer: Ronnie Hobbs, email:  ronald.hobbs@us.af.mil: (405) 736-7124 or address: 3001 Staff Drive STE 1AE1 104A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3020.  All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM CST, 10 JUN 2016.  All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.      
1. Does your typical contractual arrangement with vendors and subcontractors require them to submit a small business participation report in electronic format, for ease of collection of data?  If no, does the Prime include the supplier small business participation with the company total?
2. The Government intends to include Small Business Participation as an Evaluation Factor in the Source Selection.  Currently, the Government is considering a 15% small business requirement.  This requirement is based on allowing the contractor to utilize second tier-subcontractors within their small business percentages for meeting the requirement.
Note-This is not the same as the small business subcontracting goals required by FAR 19.702, DFAR 219.708, and AFFAR 5319.7 that will be submitted within the contractors subcontracting plan.  The information submitted in response to the Small Business evaluation factor is a contractual requirement, and must be met in ordered to be determined technically acceptable.
3. The Government is researching incentive opportunities. Below is a ""notional"" table reflecting Total Non-Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) and Mission Capable (MC) incentive earnings, tying the performance requirements with a monetary incentive.  Based on the notional model below, the metrics would be calculated by the performance of all five (5) locations collectively.

Beechcraft is the only source that can provide this requirement because they are the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the T-34 and T-44 aircraft.  As the OEM, Beechcraft owns all of the data rights, extensive pre and post-construction design analyses, testing, and results.  Without the OEMâ€™s intellectual properties, historical information, and relevant data resources, the U.S Navyâ€™s T-34  and  T-44 Trainer Fleet operations, modifications, and repair will come to a halt and the FRCSEâ€™s ability to sufficiently support the Navyâ€™s aircraft fleet demands and requirements would be negatively impacted.
  This requirement is to provide technical data usage via a Data License Agreement (DLA) including Royalty Fees assessed for each T-44  and  T-34 Aircraft inducted into the Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE) as needed to accomplish the mission in support of the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) Fleet Support Team (FST) and FRCSE.  The Data License Agreement shall set forth the terms and conditions which shall apply to the licensing of the technical information and services provided by Beechcraft to the Government in support of the program.  This agreement shall be in effect throughout the life of the contract (including all option year periods).  Technical data usage includes access to Beechcraft specifications, structures, and systems drawings.
  Technical data usage will be limited in scope to aircraft inducted for Depot-level maintenance at Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE).  A royalty fee will be assessed for each T-34 and T-44 inducted into FRCSE.  

The applicable North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) code that this work falls under is 541330 Engineering Services, with a size standard of $15M.  This notice of intent is for information purposes only.  All sources eligible to provide this requirement must respond in writing.  Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide this requirement as outlined above.  A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response.
