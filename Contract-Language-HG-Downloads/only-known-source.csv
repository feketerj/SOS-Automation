MARC will perform technical support services in the areas of: Reliability Assessment and Reporting Systems, Data Systems Evaluation, Test Program Evaluation, Program Support, and Numerical Techniques Development.  MARC&rsquo;s unique combination of expertise and 40 years of experience with the FBM program positions them to provide immediate response to emergent problems without requiring extensive training; thus, MARC is considered the only known source capable of performing this effort.  It would take an extensive amount of additional training to position another contractor at the level of MARC&rsquo;s expertise. Moreover, the contractor would lack the methodology history, of which MARC has.  Consequently, SSP intends to solicit and negotiate a contract on a sole source basis per the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) (FAR Subsection 6.302-1 &ndash; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).

SSP anticipates awarding a Firm-Fixed Price, Level-of-Effort (LOE), one (1) year base contract for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 with a total of four (4) option year periods. For FY 2027 through FY 2030.  Security Clearance Required.  Each LOE line item is estimated to cover a twelve (12) month period of performance and will include option provisions to increase the LOE up to thirty percent (30%), in accordance with SSP terms and conditions.

10d7916162c84d529a74dcbfbe4f6bb5,6973GH-25-J-1200,PVP Camera IR 60-1200mm HD,"Title of Procurement
CBP - PVP Camera IR 60-1200mm HD

Nature of Procurement Action
Modification of existing contract 6973GH-24-D-00072 to add a direct replacement, IR 60-1200mm HD
camera. Lightweight 200-1200 HD IR is obsolete but will still have limited repair. If the camera needs
a Circuit Card Assembly (CCA), it will become beyond economical Repair (BER). Customs Border
Protection (CBP) will continue to use the Lightweight 200-1200 HD IR Camera until it is BER.
This is to continue an existing requirement for persistent surveillance technology along the Southern
Border of the United States. The Cameras are Utilized specifically by the Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT)
program for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).


The IR camera is a single piece of an integrated sensor suite consisting of IR and day cameras, laser
illuminators, pan tilt units and ground radar panels. All of these components must be controlled via a
single user interface provided by the command and control software. To introduce a piece of
technology made by a different manufacturer would take thousands of labor hours to test and
validate. The purchase and repair of the current IR camera is already included within the existing
IDIQ 6973GH-24-D-00072, however that camera originally included is not out of production and repair
components to keep them in operation are no longer available. PVP Aero the OEM created the IR 60-
1200mm HD camera to be a direct form, fit, function replacement for the obsolete lightweight 1200
HD IR. Due to the complexity and expense of integrating mixed hardware and the urgent demand for
surveillance technology on the border it is recommended that this effort is awarded under Single
Source Procedures to the existing IDIQ.

Description of Supplies/Services
The Federal Aviation Administration Logistics Center (FAALC) proposes to acquire, under single source
procedures, the inclusion of the IR 60-1200mm HD camera to replace existing fielded cameras some
of which have failed and cannot be repaired. Also repair services for these cameras and spare inventory
to be maintained by the government.

Authority
Authority for single source procurement is provided by AMS policy section 3.2.2.4.
An Inter-Agency Agreement between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal
Aviation Administration Logistics Center (FAALC) authorizes and funds the FAALC to provide the DHS
Customs &amp; Border Protection Agency (CBP) with supply chain management support, including the
award and administration of supplier contracts, as required for U.S. Border Security Systems and
necessary to accomplish the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency&rsquo;s mission.

Rationale Supporting Use of a Single Source
This award is being processed under Single Source Procedures, based upon the vendor&rsquo;s experience,
knowledge and expertise on the IFT system and equipment. The current request is also urgent in that
some cameras have failed and can no longer be repaired. The government has exhausted all the
remaining spares available, and this number was insufficient to keep up with the camera failures due
to the age of the equipment. Without immediate replacements the current loss of surveillance and
detection capabilities will continue. This allows for undetected threats to enter the United States.
Further detail is described below.


PVP&rsquo;s Knowledge and Expertise
The IFT program is used to protect our nation&rsquo;s borders from illegal aliens, weapons, and drug
trafficking under our Department of Homeland Security.
PVP Aero is the Original Equipment Manufacturer that can provide hardware that will seamlessly
integrate within their proprietary control system Due to the uniqueness of the system, especially the
sensor suite, PVP&rsquo;s knowledge and expertise is the only known source that will satisfy the needs of the
Government.


Urgent Time Frame
The &ldquo;like&rdquo; camera on the current contract is obsolete and can no longer be repaired if it requires a
circuit card. All spares inventory has been exhausted. The spares the government had available was
insufficient to bring all IFT sites back online. We currently have two sites offline and expect this trend
to continue as cameras reach the end of their lifecycle. With a gap in surveillance coverage, illegal
crossings will continue to go undetected. There have been many recent articles stating the increase
of illegal activity, including potential terrorism threats to the United States.


Border Surveillance is essential to carry out the CBP&rsquo;s mission statement, including the prevention of
illegal entry of people (Human Trafficking), drugs (specifically Fentanyl seizures) and weapons
(Trafficking from the Unites States to outside destinations). This information supports the need for
this requirement to be processed to aid in accomplishing CBP&rsquo;s mission, which will provide better
security for the United States borders and citizens.

Market Analysis
A formal Market survey was posted to SAM.gov on March 21, 2025, with a closing date of April 04, 2025.  There were no responses recieved. PVP Aero is the Original
Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only supplier who can service or build the IR 60-1200mm HD.

Other Facts Supporting Use of Single Source
This procurement is to acquire critical surveillance technology to counter threats to the security of the
border. This is an immediate and urgent need.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03825QB0000079 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2025-03 Effective January 17, 2025.

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Ametek, Inc (Cage Code: 61349). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM approved source.

See attached documents titled: 

&ldquo;Requirements &ndash; 70Z03825QB0000079,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Terms and Conditions &ndash; 70Z03825QB0000079&rdquo; and

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the government.  The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

fd04899b24454f408f17a54bf46c6c19,70Z03825QB0000070,Notice of Intent to Award to Sole Source BOA,"This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03825QB0000070 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2025-03 Effective January 17, 2025.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is a restricted requirement with intent to award to Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) SPE4A1-19-G-0012. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price delivery order shall be awarded on a Sole Source basis to Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation (Cage Code: 0B9R9). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from the OEM or an OEM approved source.

See attached documents titled:

&ldquo;Requirements &ndash; 70Z03825QB0000070,&rdquo;

&ldquo;Terms and Conditions &ndash; 70Z03825QB0000070&rdquo; and

&ldquo;Redacted J and A &ndash; 70Z03825QB0000070&rdquo;.

52.217-6 Option for Increased Quantity (MAR 1989) applies to this acquisition and is tailored as follows:

For Line Item 1, the Government may increase the quantity of supplies called for in the Schedule by up to a quantity of Twenty Five (25), at the unit price specified, up to a maximum quantity of Forty (40). The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the period of the current BOA as extended. Delivery of the added items shall continue at the same rate as the like items call for under the Delivery Order, unless the parties otherwise agree.

***Please note that if the USCG chooses to exercise any optional quantity modification, such modifications will be issued unilaterally to the contractor.

(End of Clause)

It is the Government&#39;s belief that Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation is the only known source to provide traceability and genuine OEM parts with the packaging requirements stated in the Component Maintenance Manual (CMM). Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of conformance (COC). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15 outline these certification procedures.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

The Rotor Mast is an assembly of parts not all having the same item name which is used as an extension between the transmission and rotor hub on the UH-1N ACFT.
The 90 Degree Gearbox is located at the top of the tail-boom vertical fin. The gearbox provides 90-degree change in direction of the drive train and 2.6:1 speed reduction between input driveshaft and its output shaft on which the tail rotor is mounted. The gearbox consists of mating input and output gear quill assemblies set into a gear case provided with a breather-type oil filler cap, oil level sight gauge, and a drain plug with a chip detector. The input quill has a flexible coupling for attachment of driveshaft. Control linkage is attached on the left side with a control rod extending through the rotor shaft.
The 42 Degree Gearbox is an intermediate gearbox located on the tail-boom, at the base of the vertical fin. This gearbox provides a 42-degree change in direction of the tail rotor drive-shafts, with no speed change. The gearbox assembly consists of a case with a gear quill in each end. The case is fitted with an oil filter cap, an oil level sight gauge, and a drain plug equipped with a magnetic insert. The input and output quills have flexible couplings for attachment of drive-shafts. Access is provided by a vented cover with quick- release fasteners.



The Gate Valve is a Motor Operated Fuel Shutoff Valve that is part of the Filter Fuel System Installation of the TH-1H and UH-1N ACFTs.  The fuel shutoff valves open or close to control the flow of fuel to the engines. Power is supplied to these valves by the essential bus through circuit breakers.

1. Semiannual (every 6 months) software updates to the TAWS Tactical Database, and
2. Annual software updates to the TAWS Commercial Database
This requirement is for the United States Government (USG) C-130J fleet to maintain flight safety and mission capability.
Our software engineering services strategy is a four-year contract and will continue from FY25 to FY29. The projected quantities will be Best Estimated Quantities (BEQ) of ~416 licensed updates initially every 6 months with increases in BEQ of 25 each year.
The Government&rsquo;s need for software engineering services is required in order to support current worldwide operations for C-130J aircraft and all variants. The Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) provides terrain/obstacle alerting and display functions using aircraft inputs based on sensed geographic position, attitude, altitude, and airspeed combined with internal terrain, obstacle, and airport databases to predict a potential conflict between the aircraft flight path and terrain or an obstacle. TAWS utilizes commercial and tactical internal terrain/obstacle databases. Commercial databases normally contain only ICAO airports with runway lengths greater than 3,500 feet.

LOCATION:  Robins AFB, GA 31098-1813

RE: Sources Sought for Manufacturers of P/N: 4C95009-153D, C-5 Mechanical Actuator

SUBJECT: 

Market research is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of the C-5 Mechanical Actuator (NSN: 1680-01-181-9991UC P/N: 4C95009-153D).

ITEM DESCRIPTION: 

The responsibility of an aircraft slat actuation system is to precisely control the movement of the leading-edge slats on the wings, extending them during low-speed flight phases like takeoff and landing to increase lift by modifying the wing&#39;s camber and allowing the aircraft to operate at lower speeds while maintaining stable flight, and retracting them during high-speed flight to minimize drag; essentially, it manages the slats&#39; position to optimize lift according to flight conditions. 

IMPEDIMENT TO COMPETITION: Ontic Engineering &amp; Manufacturing (Cage: 45934) is the only approved manufacturer of this item. They maintain its proprietary manufacturing data for this item.  The Government does not own a complete manufacturing data package to release to potential vendors in support of this requirement. Although this item is similar to commercial items, without rights to the data the Government cannot determine if a suitable substitute would perform the original part&rsquo;s intended function.  This mechanical actuator is a critical component of the C-5 aircraft. As a result, Ontic Engineering &amp; Manufacturing is the only known source with adequate knowledge of the C-5 mechanical actuator performance requirements and possession of the required technical data and capabilities needed to produce these items and ensure compatibility of the equipment. 

INTEREST The DLA/AWB Contracting Office intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 ( 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1)), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements in order to fulfill the Government&rsquo;s requirement for the mechanical actuator in support of the C-5 program. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than 14 February 2025 by emailing Mobolaji Ogunsakin Jr. at mobolaji.ogunsakin.1@us.af.mil and Christine Smith at christine.smith.20@us.af.mil.

NSN/Part Number: TBD still in development stage

Solicitation Number:  FA8214-25S-FT3PD

Notice Type:  Sources Sought Synopsis


	NOTICE:  This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.




1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside.  The product service code is 14.  The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336419 which has a corresponding Size standard of 1000.  The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement.  The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, HUBZone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.  The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code.  Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.  Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.




	 Details




This synopsis does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation, Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to set aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.  The Government intends to establish a new contract for the production of FT3 flight test kits (replenishment spares) used to support the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (MMIII ICBM) Force Development Evaluation (FDE) Operational Test Launch (OTL) Program.


	 Background




AFGSC conducts the ICBM Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (OT&amp;E) program in accordance with AFGSC Instruction 99-102, ICBM Operational Test and Evaluation.  The ICBM OT&amp;E program provides accuracy and reliability planning factors to the Commander, United States Strategic Command, and evaluates the operational effectiveness and suitability of system modifications or upgrades prior to initial fielding.  The ICBM OT&amp;E includes OTLs, which are flown from the Western Test Range (WTR) located at Vandenberg Space Force Base (VSFB), California, and conducted by the 576th Flight Test Squadron.  The OTLs, designated GLORY TRIPs, consist of flight tests of operational ICBMs in a peacetime environment in as near to the operational flight environment as possible from first stage ignition to impact. When flying on the WTR, the operational missiles must be equipped for range tracking, missile telemetry, and flight termination. The flight test kit integrates these capabilities into one complete system. AFGSC is planning to conduct approximately four OTLs per year through the life of the MMIII ICBM Weapon System (~2040).



All flight test kits must be compliant with Range Safety requirements:  Range Commander&rsquo;s Council (RCC) 319-14(T), Flight Termination Systems Commonality Standard; RCC 324-11(T), Global Positioning and Inertial Measurements Range Safety Tracking Systems&rsquo; Commonality Standard; RCC 313-01(T), Test Standards for Flight Termination Receivers/Decoder; and AFSPCMAN 91-710 (T), Range Safety User Requirements Manual Volume 1 - Air Force Space

Command Range Safety Policies and Procedures.   




	 CONTRACTOR CAPABILITIES 




Subject to the Government&rsquo;s consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite product and services should submit a concise and program specific response, presenting sufficient information to substantiate they have demonstrated the capability for the following:




	A flight test kit qualified to the above-mentioned requirements and product specifications (available upon request) for delivery in time for first scheduled launch, 1 October 2030. The Government will not incur costs for any necessary development or qualification of the system. 
	FT3 flight test kit deliveries must support AFGSC&rsquo;s 5-year flight test schedule with just-in-time deliveries 120 days ahead of scheduled launch dates. It is anticipated this schedule will continue for the life of MMIII.
	Delivery of the flight test kit consisting of four sub-kits, (1) Integrated Instrumentation System (IIS), (2) Electronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD) for downstage install, (3) Electrical Cable Assembly Set, and the (4) Ordnance to be shipped to four staging areas at VSFB, and conduct acceptance test procedures.
	Strict scrutiny and emphasis will be placed on the contractor&rsquo;s piece-parts program, configuration management process, systems engineering process, and quality standards to include its subcontractors.  Specifically, a parts program (5,000+ piece-parts) will avoid parts obsolescence issues, demonstrate how quantities of parts are purchased and how lots are controlled, part screening to detect any electrical or mechanical workmanship defects and infant mortality failure modes, and will accomplish functional testing at the piece-parts and/or subsystem level.
	Maintain that the Government will own the technical baseline and all associated data.
	Use of contractor logistics support.
	Use of standard AF and ICBM enterprise maintenance data collection systems, databases and processes when necessary.

this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested 
and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03825QB0000034 is issued 
as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and 
clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2025-02 Effective

Airbus Helicopters, INC. as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear 
traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage 
Code: F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which
