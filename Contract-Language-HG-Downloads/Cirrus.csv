The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto.
The NASA GSFC PACE poloarimeter instrument requirements are as follows:
The PACE Project is considering the procurement of a multi-angle polarimeter instrument to provide ongoing and improved observations of aerosols and clouds and to enhance the capabilities of the primary Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) regarding ocean color atmospheric correction.
Overall, the purpose of the PACE mission is to make global measurements of ocean color, clouds, and aerosol particles to enable unprecedented studies of ocean ecology, aquatic biogeochemistry, and the forcings and feedbacks that control the climate.
The PACE project is being executed as a Design-To-Cost (DTC) mission where a fixed amount of funding has been allocated to execute all aspects of the mission. The polarimeter will be a secondary instrument on the PACE spacecraft, and thus if the projected cost of the instrument exceeds our allocated budget for this instrument, it will not be procured.
The polarimeter should be considered a class &lsquo;C' instrument per &lsquo;NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 8705.4 Risk Classification for NASA Payloads' and should be designed, fabricated and tested according to standard space flight requirements.
A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract type is anticipated for any Request for Proposal that may result from this RFI.
Polarimeter Instrument Overview and Science ObjectivesA procured polarimeter will be used to collect measurements of some or all of the following aerosol properties under cloud-free scenes, scenes with aerosols over low-level clouds, and partly cloudy scenes with aerosols below clouds:&bull; Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) &bull; Single Scattering Albedo (SSA)&bull; Asymmetry factor of the aerosol scattering phase function&bull; Aerosol refractive index&bull; Water uptake by aerosols&bull; Aerosol size distributions&bull; Aerosol number concentration, which determines the total amount of potential Cloud Condensation Nucleus (CCN)&bull; Aerosol shape&bull; Aerosol layer height
A polarimeter instrument will also be used to collect measurements of some or all of the following cloud properties:&bull; Cloud Optical Thickness&bull; Cloud Albedo&bull; Cloud Droplet Effective Radius&bull; Cloud Droplet number concentration&bull; Cloud Phase&bull; Cloud base/top height&bull; Cloud cover
The measurements of the aerosol and cloud properties given above will address the following scientific objectives:
&bull; Improve representation of clouds and aerosols in climate modelsDetailed and accurate measurements of optical properties (AOT, SSA, phase function) from a procured instrument will allow validating and improving the optical aerosol properties in climate models. This is essential to improve the model capability to calculate the direct aerosol radiative forcing. Furthermore, measurements of microphysical properties (size, composition) are required to test model parameterizations of of aerosol through their lifecycle of emission, processing, and transport. Relationships between aerosol and cloud properties are essential for model evaluation and improvements in estimates of the indirect aerosol forcing.
&bull; Atmospheric correction for ocean color remote sensingA primary focus of the PACE mission is to retrieve water-leaving reflectance spectra for use in deriving marine optical properties and key biological and biogeochemical variables. Achieving highly accurate water-leaving reflectance requires proper characterization of atmospheric properties, including aerosol particles, which has been shown to be challenging in the presence of absorbing aerosols. Improved characterization of aerosol particles from the proposed instrument will enhance this ocean color atmospheric correction process.
