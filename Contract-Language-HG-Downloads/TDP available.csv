Notice Type: Sources Sought



This Request for Information (RFI) is for source planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, requests for quotation, request for proposal, abstracts, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as informational only. No entitlement to pay, direct or indirect costs, or charges to the Government will arise, as a result of a contractor&#39;s submission of a response(s) to this announcement or the Government&#39;s use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for future proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. The information provided may be used by the Government in developing its source acquisition strategy and Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and performance specifications. The Government does not intend to award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information that will assist the Utility Helicopters Project Office (UHPO) in evaluating vendor capability of meeting its potential need. The Government has not determined the acquisition approach. This market research will allow the UHPO to make an informed decision about how to proceed.



It is contemplated that this award will be made on an Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAOC), Sole Source basis in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. The Government intends to solicit and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for these requirements. The anticipated contract period of performance is June 2024 through June 2029.



This RFI is applicable to the following UHPO Mission Design Series (MDS): UH-60M, HH-60M, UH-60L, HH-60L, UH-60A and HH-60A for Army, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Other Government Agencies (OGA). The Government does not own the complete H-60 Technical Data Packages (TDPs) that established the current and baseline H-60 MDS configurations, including system/subsystems drawings, tooling drawings, software source code or models and simulations.

The intent of this RFI is to determine industry capabilities to design, develop, test, integrate, validate and verify hardware and software systems, subsystems and system of systems, maintain configuration management, develop and update the Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) documentation to support each H-60 MDS configuration. System and subsystems must meet Airworthiness Release (AWR) criteria and be able to be integrated into the UH-60M and HH-60M production helicopters via Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), with an objective of integrating common systems and subsystems into all H-60 MDS configurations while minimizing the logistics infrastructure.

The vendor must be capable of sustaining and maintaining the inherent H-60 MDS configuration over its lifecycle that maintains the inherent technical, suitability and functional performance, safety, reliability, sustainability and maintainability characteristics.  The vendor must maintain an office with technical, logistic and contracting personnel in Huntsville, AL vicinity.  The vendor must be able to obtain and maintain personnel and facilities at the SECRET clearance level.  The Government desires that all software and hardware have, at a minimum, Government Purpose Rights (GPR) and software development meets Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) level III criteria and processes.

The vendor must be capable of complying with the Safeguarding of Controlled Unclassified Technical Information clause in DFARS 252.204-7012, have a Cybersecurity program that follows the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity document at a minimum, and subsequent compliance assessments performed by the Government.
