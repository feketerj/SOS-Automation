The Government intends to acquire these services using the provisions, clauses, and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, specifically FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.



This is a sole-source requirement to Bell Textron Inc as WAPAs current fleet of four (4) helicopters are all Bell 407 models. Purchase of another Bell model 407 to phase out an existing aging aircraft will enable economies of scale in both flight maintenance, operation, and provisioning (i.e., spare parts and equipment) for the aircraft and training and utilization of the pilots. Procuring a different helicopter other than a Bell 407 will cause increased costs to the agency in spare parts and inventory as well as other logistical issues concerning requiring another manufacturers service center for maintenance requirements.



The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 336411, and the size standard is 1,500 employees. It is anticipated this action will result in a firm-fixed-price contract with Bell Textron Inc on or about September 15, 2021. Delivery and acceptance is anticipated to take place at origin six (6) months after contract award at the manufacturers facility in Piney Flats, TN.



A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received from all responsible sources will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.



This notice of intent is not a competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ). No solicitation package will be publicly issued. In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This contract requirement was to obtain depot level inspection and repair capabilities for the TH-1H aircraft.  The United States Air Force (USAF) TH-1H helicopter is the result of major modifications to a refurbished UH-1H cabin.  The modifications include engine, drive train, structural, tail-boom, and rotor modifications as part of the Bell UH-1H-II (Huey II) kit, a Bell 212 nose, an avionics upgrade including glass cockpit displays, and crashworthy seat modifications.  The TH-1H is the USAF's primary rotary wing trainer stationed at Cairns Army Airfield (AAF), an airfield just off the main post of Ft Rucker, AL.  The primary purpose of the TH-1H aircraft Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) program is to accomplish all repairs beyond the capabilities of the operating units, including rebuild, overhaul, and extensive modification of equipment platforms, systems, and subsystems.  This program consists of aircraft zonal inspections of structures and components (including primary structural flight components, critical safety items, engines, drivetrain elements, avionics, etc.) and may require removal, repairing and installation of components to the extent required to conduct a detailed airframe inspection.  The PDM program includes corrosion control and structural rehabilitation elements critical to extend operational period of the airframe.  The Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) requirements shall also include unscheduled maintenance and the deployment of Contractor Field Teams (CFT).  Emergency Drop-In maintenance shall be considered as an unscheduled requirement.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), NAS Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award an order to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc (BHTI), Fort Worth, TX, under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement, to perform a structural analysis of the MQ-8C weapons sockets.   The results of the study will assist in determination of what size/type of weapons can be carried, how they would be mounted, and how they would impact aircraft structural integrity.  
 
For this proposed contract action, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, ""Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."" BHTI was selected the sole source subcontractor of the MQ-8C airframe by Northrop Grumman Corporation. BHTI is unwilling to sell the data rights that would allow for competitive procurements required to complete the engineering study/analysis. As a result, only BHTI has the technical data, unique engineering support experience and detailed knowledge of the commercial Bell 407 aircraft to meet the Department of the Navy's requirements.
 
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. The Government will consider all information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained.

(BHTI), Fort Worth, TX for the procurement of the following items: Up to an additional ten (10) Bell 407 variant commercial helicopters, associated Bell 407 unique components, support equipment,  preservation and storage, and engineering support through FY 2021. These contract efforts are in support of the Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) requirements under the MQ-8C Fire Scout Unmanned Air System (UAS) Program of Record (POR) with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) which authorizes a quantity up to forty (40) MQ-8C Fire Scout Air Vehicles through FY 2022. 
The proposed contract action(s) are those for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, ""Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."" BHTI is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the commercial Bell 407 helicopter selected by NGC for inclusion in the MQ-8C Fire Scout System design. The US Government has since broken the airframe out as GFE. It is the only known airframe configuration that meets the minimum requirements in support of existing production of the MQ-8C Fire Scout. BHTI is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the commercial Bell 407, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's GFE airframe requirements on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner.
