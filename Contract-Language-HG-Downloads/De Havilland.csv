The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 336412 Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing; the small business size standard is 1500 Employees




	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has an urgent requirement to obtain several fuel control unit modification kits applicable exclusively to the NOAA DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. These kits are required to comply with applicable Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Directives as well as Transport Canada Service Bulletins. These modification kits are exclusively available from the aircraft manufacture, Viking Air.




The Government is not aware of any other vendors that are authorized to provide, service, or support this Fan request without compromising OEM delivery, or additional markups. The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Viking Air

Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-6-1, DHC-6-100, DHC-6-200, DHC-6-300, and DHC-6-400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as binding of the rod end bearing connecting the lower fuel control unit (FCU) push rod assembly to the FCU power lever. This AD requires performing tests, inspections, and lubrication of the FCU push rod assemblies, and replacing them with improved parts as necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.



The Government intends to acquire this service under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with Viking Air Limited, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).



This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. Award is to be made 7/18/2022 however notice shall remain posted for 14 days.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of the required service while also be authorized by the manufacture.

The capability statement, a price list and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the system requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Christopher Baker at Christopher.Baker@noaa.gov.

A general visual inspection will also occur during the above-mentioned inspections, and any discrepancies will be provided in report form at the conclusion of the inspection. Discrepancies may include working rivets, structural cracks, other structural or component fatigue, fluid leaks, and workmanship issues noticed visually. 
Additionally, an Engineering Analysis effort will be undertaken to confirm proper structural and aerodynamic incorporation of the telemetry antenna housing (commonly called the canoe) running along the starboard, underbelly of the aircraft. Communication with the OEM is expected that will result in updated aileron and rudder rigging to account for the aerodynamic loading associated with the antenna housing. The output of this effort will be a rigging procedure that can be completed whenever aileron or rudder work is done in the future. The contractor is required to have recent experience (within the last 10 years) with DHC-8-103 aircraft or similar variant of the DHC-8 aircraft.  Experience with equipment racks and operator workstations in DHC-8 aircraft is also preferred. The contractor must have experience conducting audits on modified DHC-8 aircraft as well as proper management of Aircraft Technical Data Packages (inclusive of engineering drawings from previous contractors, understanding of FAA certifications, ability to review engineering reports and supplemental manuals.)

NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) CONTRACT LANGUAGE

NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)


	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:



	
	
		Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.
	
	



	
	
		Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.
	
	



	
	
		Identify constraints in transparency and process.
	
	



	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.



	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer&#39;s decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.



	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman&#39;s authority, for instance:



	
	
		Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.
	
	


                       The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.


	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA&#39;s agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).
	
	



	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.



	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.



	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.

DHC-8 Fixed Wing Mission Support Aircraft



1.0  General Information



The Aviation Integration Directorate is conducting market research in support of the purchase and modification of a De Havilland Canada Dash 8 (DHC-8) aircraft.  Aircraft modifications are substantial in scope and quantity (approximately 55), and include Supplemental Type Certificated (STC&rsquo;d) and unique, customer specific modifications.  The Government requests industry information on cost-effective acquisition options.  The expected end result of this effort will be a fully modified, documented and substantiated DHC-8 aircraft.  The Government does not possess a full technical data package for all of the intended modifications.  Interested vendors will need to be capable of designing, modifying, substantiating and documenting aircraft modifications.  Responses should address the experience the vendor has designing and modifying aircraft, their substantiation and documentation process and their ability to minimize and manage development costs.



This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 10, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This announcement is for informational and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to pay for any information, or otherwise reimburse responders for any costs associated with their respective submissions in response to this RFI.  All submissions will be treated as information only.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any review of this RFI; however, clarification of submissions may be requested by the Contracting Officer.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this RFI or any subsequent issued RFP, if any.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.  All products must comply with the Buy American Act and participation in this effort is strictly voluntary.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. No solicitation document exists at this time. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336411 and the small business size standard is 1,500 employees.

The Point of contact for this Notice is: Phaedra Fuller, Contracting Officer, National Park Service, Olympic National Park, 600 E. Park Avenue Port Angeles, WA 98362. Telephone: 360-565-3009 Email: Phaedra_Fuller@nps.gov.
JUSTIFICATION &amp; APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
1. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEM/SERVICE BEING PROCURED AND ITS INTENDED USE (INCLUDE THE ANTICIPATED COST): The National Park Service Contracting Office proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. This acquisition is for a new, firm fixed price contract to be awarded to Century Aviation for purchase a cosmetically restored Liberty V-12 engine complete with an exhibit stand that will be put on permanent display next to a restored circa 1919 De Havilland DH-4B ""Liberty"" observation aircraft at the Pearson Air Museum. Estimated acquisition cost is $40,000.
2. SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE: Only one responsible source, authorized as follows: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)(or 10 USC 2304(c) (1)) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, ""Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.""
EXPLAIN (DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION): Century Aviation is uniquely qualified to provide a cosmetically restored V-12 Liberty engine, as the company specializes in the restoration and shipment of historic aircraft, and has a proven track record with rare and unique aircraft, including Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose currently on display at the Evergreen Air &amp; Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon. Century Aviation is currently under contract with NPS to provide a fully restored ca. 1919 DH-4B Liberty observation aircraft that will be delivered and put on permanent display at the Pearson Air Museum. The restoration was awarded to Century Aviation on two separate contracts: P14PC00484, Restoration Phase I awarded as sole source, and P15PX02994 Restoration Phase II that was competed, and awarded to Century Aviation. This same contractor also competed for and received the award of providing the Pearson Air Museum a ca. 1911 Curtiss Pusher plan full scale kit (Contract no. P15PX03422). Beyond these NPS-specific contracts, Century Aviation has a proven track record of reconstructing, building new, and refurbishing historic aircraft and other museum-quality exhibits for vendors across the world. They have cosmetically, and internally reconstructed at least six other Liberty V-12 engines for other projects in the past two decades. The above past acquisition history is to support our belief that this is a uniquely qualified vendor in the area of historic aircraft restoration.
3. MARKET RESEARCH. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE RESULTS OR WHY ONE WAS NOT PERFORMED. STATE WHETHER ANY OTHER OFFERS WERE RECEIVED OR ANYONE EXPRESSED INTEREST: NPS staff at Pearson Air Museum have been looking to acquire a Liberty V-12 aircraft engine for exhibit since 2014. Searches have been made on the internet, as well as by manually perusing aviation related sales magazines, specifically ""Trade-A-Plane."" In these past two years, staff have only encountered two separate Liberty V-12 engines available for sale. In September, 2014, an on-line advertisement for a Liberty V-12 was discovered from a boat shop in New York. E-mail exchanges with St Lawrence Restoration showed a firm price of $55,000 for an engine in working condition, but installed in a boat (see attached). There were no discussions on the costs of shipping. In March, 2015, another Liberty V-12 was discovered for sale on EBay. The engine was in Venezuela, in working condition, with a ""Buy It Now"" price of $45,000 US. The description stated that the buyer would have to make shipping arrangements. Unfortunately, a digital record of this Ebay advertisement was not kept. After looking through two years of advertisements in ""Trade-A-Plane"" no Liberty V-12 engines have been advertised for sale during this time period. In short, these engines are rare, in short supply, and are rarely advertised for sale. Only 40,000 were constructed in 1918, and it is likely that under 1,000 are extant today. It is unlikely that another will be advertised for sale near the quoted price from Century Aviation ($25,000 delivered). This Justification will be transmitted to the GPE (FedBizOps) as part of a Special Notice, in accordance with 5.203(a), stating in the notice that all responsible sources may submit a capabilities statement or quotation that shall be considered by the agency.
4. IF THIS IS A DETERMINATION FOR SOLE SOURCE, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFIES:a. Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist.b. The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a). /s/ Bob Cromwell, Acting Chief Ranger, Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, 6/3/16/s/ Phaedra Fuller, Contracting Officer, Olympic National Park, 6/17/16/s/ Rod Roberson, OLYM MABO Lead, Olympic National Park, 6/28/16
