This system provides battle-damaged airfields with a transportable and relocatable arresting system capable of stopping United States and Coalition Forces tailhook fighter aircraft declaring an in-flight or ground emergency. The trailer has a unique feature and requirement by which it must be able to lower itself (kneel) to the ground and raise to its normal configuration using the on-board hydraulic system. The trailer comprises all auxiliary equipment and hardware for anchoring to concrete, asphalt, or soil surfaces and is a highly specialized system essential in the execution of airfield flying operations.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program



It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).



Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.



Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).



Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.



Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

&quot;Reparable End Items&quot; are defined as end items which can be restored to a serviceable condition, in accordance
with applicable requirements. Some units of items listed in Section B may, upon disassembly and/or inspection, be

Contractors are cautioned that until a contract is executed, any effort performed in support of the anticipated
effort is performed strictly at their own risk and expense. There is no authorization to begin performance until the
contractor has received a duly authorized contract signed by the Contracting Officer. Also, this request for proposal
is not to be construed to mean that the award of a contract is assured, as the availability of funds, timely
submission of all requested documents, and acceptance by both parties are prerequisite to any contract award.

The UH-1N has a fleet of 68 and supports the Presidential Mission. This part must be repaired by a source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of ASME Y14.100, Engineering Drawing and Related Documentation Practices. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge is not available to permit repair by other sources. This is not a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) item sold or repaired on the open market to both civilian and government customers. The only source currently approved is the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Aero Dynamix Inc. (CAGE Code: 01FX2) as they developed the modification as part of a supplemental type certificate (STC) for other aircraft and Aero Dynamix owns the data rights to the night vision modification that was applied to the model GNS 530AW. The GNS530W is an IFR capable precision approach GPS, VHF radio, and VOR receiver. The GNS530AW also provide terrain avoidance and warning capability. Due to lack of technical data, full and open competition is not an option. Current need for operational components does not allow for unqualified sources to take the time necessary to reverse engineer each component in order to conduct a repair. While there are vendors capable of repairing a standard GNS530AW, the only approved vendor for the NVIS modified GNS530AWs is Aero Dynamix Inc.

This is a sole source requirement to Aero Dynamix, Inc. (CAGE Code: 01FX2), 3227 West Euless Blvd, Euless, Texas 76040-6254. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Data or rights are not owned by the Government for this solicitation. To request a copy of this solicitation, go to http://www.sam.gov. Approximate issue date of solicitation is 23 April 2023.

        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.
        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.
3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.

	Identification of the justification rationale and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor&rsquo;s unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.


10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B). Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B).

This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Weapon System Support Office tasked NSWC PCD to procure SSC Skirt Systems and provide to the SSC shipbuilder for the FY 2020 Continued Craft Construction Contract and spares for Government use during SSC Post Delivery Test and Trials (PDT&amp;T). The qualifications to build the skirts were incorporated into the Amphibious Craft, Air Cushion Project Peculiar Document No. 802-6336529G, Skirt Material Characteristics and Requirements dated 8 June 2020 and Landing Craft, Air Cushion Project Peculiar Document NO. 802-6336530D, Skirt Fabrication Procedures dated 8 Aug 2013.  The manufacturing of the SSC skirt systems is governed by two LCAC Project Peculiar Documents (PPDs) because of the unique material and fabrication requirements. PPD No. 802-6336529G governs the skirt system material characteristics and requirements. PPD No. 802-6336530D governs the skirt system fabrication and assembly procedures.  SMR and Avon are the only contractors that meet the proper materials and processes delineated in PPD No. 802-6336529G  and PPD No. 802-6336530D.  In summary Avon and SMR are the only companies with the capabilities and in-house resident knowledge of the LCAC 100 skirts that can properly fabricate and integrate a Skirt Suppressor System onto the LCAC 100.




	A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 13.106-1(b).




The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government&rsquo;s needs.



6.         A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 



As stated in paragraph 4 above, because of the highly specialized tooling and knowledge base resident with the two aforementioned approved vendors, no other vendors are capable to fulfil this requirement in a reasonable timeframe. A synopsis of this procurement in shall be posted to the Government point of entry SAM.gov.



7.         Any other facts supporting the justification.  



None





8.         A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made. 



The proposed contracts will provide competition per the quantity of SSC skirt systems required for the SSC shipbuilder to conduct the FY 2021 Continued Craft Construction phase. Because of the highly specialized tooling and knowledge base resident with the two aforementioned approve vendors, there are currently no means to remove the barrier to full and open competition.

This solicitation is for NAVSUP to consider to repair or not repair  existing unit(s). No purchases of new, used or refurbished units will be considered and are not considered offers, since this is for repair only of an existing unit(s). In order for the
government to consider an offer, the vendor must provide, along with and as part of their offer, proof that the vendor has access to the data or the rights to use the data needed to repair this part.  This data is not usually owned by the Government and will not
be provided.  For solicitations that are already determined to be restricted to a few approved vendors,your information will be considered as a potential source for future awards, not this award, should you pursue to be vetted and approved as a source. Authorized
dealers or distributors confirmed by the OEM may be considered as a potential source without waiting for future awards.  Provide the letter from the OEM as part of your quote.
All quotes need to include these cost factors, at a minimum: IUID, CAV asset processing, and packaging.
1.  This is a repair requirement.  Submit quote to the PCO listed, email preferred. Confirm receipt.
No serial numbers or failure reports will be provided for this RFQ.
The offeror shall provide an estimated price for the teardown, test, evaluation AND repair of the solicited requirement.  The award document will be an unpriced purchase order, at the price offered, established as a monetary limitation. When the contracting
officer definitizes the unpriced purchase order, the monetary limitation shall be subject to downward adjustment only.
2.  Also provide a firm fixed price to tear down, test, and evaluate. The award will not be awarded at this price.  This fixed price will be the end result after downward adjusting the price for four specific situations: this price would apply only in those
situations where NAVSUP no longer wants it repaired, or agrees with your determination that a unit is either:  beyond repair, beyond economical repair, or there is no fault found.  (None of these situations require a repair to be performed.)
3. The vendor must be able to return the unit to ""A"" condition per the unit drawings and any testing requirements.
4. The vendor is required to comply with Commercial AssetVisibility (CAV). Specify if you are a CAV or PROXYCAV supplier in the quote.
5.After award, submit a qualifying repair proposal to PCO within 30 days of receipt of units. Include your internal evaluation notes in your format for each unit, your materials list, and a scope of work for the repair, all in yourformat, internal job documents.
It also might require costs and profit, other than certified, if needed.  Based off that information a decision to repair or not will be made. Order will then be definitized for the final repair price or a price not to repair.
6. Provide an approximate price of a new item in your quote.
7. Do NOT include the cost for shipping, as the government will coordinate and pay that.
This NIIN is an emergency acquisition NIIN.
The resultant award will be issued bilaterally, if not on a BOA, requiring written acceptance prior to execution.
   A RTAT of at most 449 days is expected for repair of this item.
NAVSUP expects this can be achieved at no increase to unit pricing to the Navy.  Repair Turnaround Time (RTAT): the resultant contract is measured from asset return to the date of asset acceptance under the terms of the contract.  For purposes of this section,
Return is defined as physical receipt of the F-condition asset at the contractor's facility as reflected in the Action Date entry in the Commercial Asset Visibility (CAV) system.  In accordance with the CAV Statement of Work, the contractor is required to
accurately report all transactions by the end of the fifth regular business day after receipt and the Action Date entered in CAV must be dated to reflect the actual date of physical receipt.  The Contractor must obtain final inspection and acceptance by the
Government for all assets within the RTATs established in this contract.
   NOTE: Repair quotes shall reference the proposed RTAT, understanding the Navy's expectation of the RTAT goal.

Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.7 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor&#39;s request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a &quot;Warning Plate&quot; stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.

2382f9fd098c412ab4140060a7d3cbf5,NFFR7100-22-02494MCW,PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF 2 WIDE BAND TRANSCEIVERS TO COMPLETE THE MULTI-FREQUENCY SCIENTIFIC ECHOSOUNDER SYSTEM WITH A HULL-MOUNTED ARRAY OF 4 WIDE-BANDWIDTH TRANSDUCERS,"*** National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#39;s (NOAA) Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Ocean Gold Seafoods, Inc. of Westport, Washington, United States for the continuation of the baseline for the Cooperative Research with the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) under the management control of the Pacific Fisheries Management Council.  This requirement has needs for additional equipment for the mission needs and will be purchasing and installing 2 wide band transceivers (SIMRAD EK80 70kHz WBT and EK80 120kHz WBT)  to complete the multi-frequency scientific echosounder system with hull-mounted array of 4 wide-bandwidth transducers on F/V Lisa Marie.

***The sole source determination is based on the NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for ongoing need for testing and sampling to be added to the current baseline and maintain continuity of results already paid for and time utilized.  Another vendor could not be used without losing these established baseline for scientific results and this is a continuation of what has been in place since 2019. The approved vendor and vessel have already had multiple installations of equipment and retrofitted equipment. Any change in vendor would mean loss of the baseline, loss of time for required lengthy approvals, duplication of cost for equipment to be removed and retrofitted and not meeting the Mission. 

Purchase and installation due by 6/30/2023.


***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the government&#39;s requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

with ;MIL-STD-129; .
3.3   Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and
approval has been given by issuance of a written change order.  When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the
substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor.  If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government
evaluation.  When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements:
Code 1:  PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number.
Code 2:  Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts.

Code 4:  Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable.
Code 5:  Part redesigned - New part replaces old.  Old part cannot replace new.
Code 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable.
3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

74dc488dbe4a4de08727aa529daf8997,NFFR71002201920SRG,Purchase and installation of 2 split beam transducers and to complete the hull-mounted array of 4 wide-bandwidth transducers,"SPECIAL NOTICE



NFFR71002201920SRG





*** National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#39;s (NOAA) Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Ocean Gold Seafoods, Inc. of Westport, Washington, United States for the continuation of the baseline for the Cooperative Research with the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) under the management control of the Pacific Fisheries Management Council.  This requirement has needs for additional equipment for the mission needs and will be purchasing and installing 2 split beam transducers and to complete the hull-mounted array of 4 wide-bandwidth transducers (Simrad ES70-7C and ES120-7C) to complete the hull-mounted array of 4 wide-bandwidth transducers.



***The sole source determination is based on the NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for ongoing need for testing and sampling to be added to the current baseline and maintain continuity of results already paid for and time utilized.  Another vendor could not be used without losing these established baseline for scientific results and this is a continuation of what has been in place since 2019.   The approved vendor and vessel have already had multiple installations of equipment and retrofitted equipment. Any change in vendor would mean loss of the baseline, loss of time for required lengthy approvals, duplication of cost for equipment to be removed and retrofitted and not meeting the Mission.



Purchase and installation due by 6/30/2022.


***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the government&#39;s requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.
        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.
3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.
4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE
4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,
the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the
specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements.
4.2   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of any
inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformance
does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.
4.3   Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders)  Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during
the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

1.  SCOPE
1.1   The material covered in this contract/purchase order will be used in a crucial shipboard system.  The use of incorrect or defective material would create a high probability of failure resulting in serious personnel injury, loss of life, loss of vital
shipboard systems, or loss of the ship itself.  Therefore, the material has been designated as SPECIAL EMPHASIS material (Level I, Scope of Certification, or Quality Assured) and special control procedures are invoked to ensure receipt of correct material.
1.1.1   DSSP Scope of Certification Material  -  Material Control Division  ;(B);  applies to this material.
1.1.2   This ;Cable Assembly; contains non-metallic materials which must satisfy the toxicity and flammability requirements of NAVSEA SS800-AG-MAN-010/P-9290.  Use of any material other than that specified requires special engineering approval and may require

Subj: SOLE SOURCE MEMORANDUM TO ACQUIRE BULKHEAD COVER (PART NUMBER 8324531) FOR MK-16 UNDERWATER BREATHING APPARATUS (UBA) FROM TECHNICAL COMPONENTS INC. (PURCHASE REQUEST 1300976040)




	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a &quot;Sole Source Justification.&quot;




This is a sole source justification. Contracting activity is the Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001 (Contracts Department Code 02).




	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.




This action will award a firm fixed price purchase order to Technical Components, Inc. 3901 Industry Blvd., Suite 6, Lakeland, FL 33811 (CAGE Code 0HEV9) for part number 8324531 bulkhead covers used in the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) UBA.




	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency&#39;s needs (including the estimated value).




The following items are being acquired:



Item

BULKHEAD, COVER

8324531

250 each



The Government&#39;s minimum needs have been verified by the certifying technical and requirements personnel. This memo does not authorize acquisition for other requirements. This acquisition will be conducted using simplified acquisition procedures with a total dollar value above micro-purchase levels, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold of $250,000.00. Delivery will be 100 each 10 weeks after award of the order and 150 each 15 weeks after award of the order. &ndash; Redacted--

4,       Identification of the justification rationale and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor&#39;s unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.

10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1

NSWC PCD Code E15 has a requirement for parts that are the covers for the Primary Electronics Assembly for the MK16 EOD Underwater Breathing Apparatus. This part seals off the external environment from entering the electronics. This procurement is unsuitable for full and open competition sole source for the following reasons. Technical Components Inc. is the only approved vendor capable of making the Bulkhead, Cover in accordance with NSWC PC Source Control Drawing 07070-8324531 utilizing machining techniques to ensure that the end item has the required low magnetic signature. Since this component is to be used in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Underwater Breathing Apparatus, it is critical that vendors already be preapproved for manufacturing such components. The Bulkhead, Cover, which is not provisioned by the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP), is part of a UBA larger assembly, which is provisioned.

Therefore it is not possible for NAVSUP to purchase the Bulkhead, Cover due to it not being a provisioned item. Only Technical Components Inc., as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), has the ability to supply the parts manufactured by their company and certify them Navy use. As such, Technical Components Inc., is the only source capable of meeting this requirement. Procuring these spare parts from another company would run the risk of incompatibility of components when maintaining and repairing divers&#39; equipment. Substitution of components is not authorized without the expressed permission of the approving authority. Any variance in the equipment used in a certified system would jeopardize the certification of the system and ultimately the mission.




	A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 13.106-l(b).




The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government&#39;s needs.






	A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.




This requirement will be synopsized on the Contract Opportunities website at SAM.gov per FAR 5.2.  No additional market research was conducted for the reasons specified in paragraph 4 above.




	Any other facts supporting the justification.




None






	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.




As stated in paragraph 4 above, Technical Components Inc. is the only source that can meet this requirement.

 (a)  For other than firm fixed priced contract line item numbers (CLINs), the Contractor agrees to segregate costs incurred under this contract/task order (TO), as applicable, at the lowest level of performance, either at the sub line item number (SLIN) or CLIN level, rather than at the total contract/TO level, and to submit invoices reflecting costs incurred at that level.  Supporting documentation in Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) for invoices shall include summaries of work charged during the period covered as well as overall cumulative summaries by individual labor categories, rates, and hours (both straight time and overtime) invoiced; as well as, a cost breakdown of other direct costs (ODCs), materials, and travel, by technical instruction (TI), SLIN, or CLIN level.  For other than firm fixed price subcontracts, subcontractors are also required to provide labor categories, rates, and hours (both straight time and overtime) invoiced; as well as, a cost breakdown of ODCs, materials, and travel invoiced.  Supporting documentation may be encrypted before submission to the prime contractor for WAWF invoice submittal.  Subcontractors may email encryption code information directly to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  Should the subcontractor lack encryption capability, the subcontractor may also email detailed supporting cost information directly to the Contracting Officer and COR; or other method as agreed to by the Contracting Officer.

(b)  Contractors submitting payment requests and receiving reports to WAWF using either Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) shall separately send an email notification to the COR and Contracting Officer on the same date they submit the invoice in WAWF.  No payments shall be due if the contractor does not provide the COR and Contracting Officer email notification as required herein.

The traceability marking may be any vendor traceability number/code which provides complete traceability to the required OQE. Traceability Marking/Identification may include such items as Nomenclature, Part Number, Technical Description, National Stock Number (NSN), etc. Traceability must be maintained through all process operations including any subcontracted operations, to the finished component. 3.16.1 When traceability markings on the material would be removed by a manufacturing or fabrication process, the marking must be recorded prior to removal and be immediately restored upon completion of the process. If this cannot be done or is impractical, an appropriate material control procedure (such as a bag and tag, tagging, and/or tote box control) must be employed. The material control procedure must provide a method of positive control to preclude commingling of material or loss of traceability. The traceability marking must be reapplied upon completion of the final manufacturing process. 3.16.2 The material control process must include requirements for the maintenance of traceability for items sent out for subcontracted operations. If such operations would remove traceability markings on the material, purchase or work orders must specify a method and marking location for remarking. The contractor must also ensure that subcontractor production controls are adequate to preclude commingling of materials during processing. 3.17 Final Inspection - The following inspections must be performed prior to Government inspection and acceptance. 3.17.1 Material Sampling - Material must be inspected for form, fit, and function. Lot acceptance must be based on zero defects and lot rejection based on one defect. The sample size must be in accordance with the sampling plan(s) in the applicable military specification or standard, federal specification or standard, or drawing to which the material was manufactured. In the absence of such sampling plans, sampling inspection must be per ANSI/ASQ-Z1.4, general inspection level II (for sample size selection code), table IIA (for sample size). SMALL LOT SIZES - For lot sizes of fifty or less, the minimum sample size must be eight units. For lot sizes of eight or less, the sample size must be one hundred percent of the lot. 3.17.2 The Manufacturer may elect to use Statistical Process Control (SPC) to assure product quality in lieu of the above attribute sampling plan, provided that the SPC methodology/system used provides acceptable products to the Government. However, the Government Inspection Activity may perform their acceptance inspection of the material using the attribute sampling plan outlined above. 3.17.3 All OQE required by the Contract and all data concerning material traceability (OQE to traceability marking) must be 100% inspected. The certification test reports must also be 100% inspected for completeness and legibility. 3.18 Test Certification - When test certifications are required elsewhere in the contract, certification documents must be positive and unqualified. Disclaimers such as &quot;to the best of our knowledge&quot; or &quot;we believe the information contained herein is true&quot; are not acceptable. 3.18.1 If material is received without the required test certification papers or with incorrect/missing data on the certification papers, the material will be rejected. 3.19 See CDRLs DI-MISC-80875 (welding procedures) and DI-MISC-80876 (weld procedure qualification data) - When production or repair welding is required, the applicable welding procedure(s) and qualification data must be submitted for review and approval. Note: These requirements do not apply to tack/spot welds. 3.19.1 Approval of the Contractor&#39;s qualification data must be obtained prior to performing any welding (production or repair). 3.19.2 If the Contractors qualification data has previously been approved by the Navy for other contracts, a copy of the original approval letter may be submitted along with the procedures and qualification data report to expedite the approval process. The approval letter must reference the applicable welding procedure and qualification data report identification/number. Prior approval does not guarantee acceptance for this or any future contracts. As far as practical, all procedures for the contract must be submitted at the same time. Welding procedures and qualification data must be submitted in a commercially available electronic format such as Adobe Acrobat PDF. The contractor must state the applicability of each weld procedure and qualification data submitted, citing the drawing number and pieces to be welded. (i.e. &quot;WP-123 and QD-123 are submitted for the weld joint between pieces 1 and 2 on drawing ABC.&quot; WP-456 and QD-456 are submitted for the hardfacing of piece 3 on drawing XYZ.&quot;) 3.19.3 The PCO&#39;s authorization for the use of weld procedure(s) and qualification data for the specific application as submitted does not mitigate the vendor&#39;s responsibility to comply with the requirements of S9074-AQ-GIB-010/248, S9074-AR-GIB-010A/278, and the contract. 3.19.4 Authority for the repair of Special Repairs in castings, the repair of wrought material, or the repair of forged material must be obtained via request for waiver from the Procurement Contracting Officer. This request must describe the defect; including size, depth, location, and a description of the proposed repair. Repairs deemed minor or nominal in accordance with S9074-AR-GIB-010/278 can be made at contractor discretion in accordance with S9074-AR-GIB-010/278 requirements; however, Weld Procedure Specification (WPS) and Procedure Qualification Record (PQR) submittals are still required. This request for NAVSUP-WSS Contracts must be submitted via the Electronic Contractor Data Submission (ECDS) application. 3.19.5 Any new procedure qualification performed under this Contract will require the vendor to provide a minimum 72 hour notification to DCMA with an offer to observe the welding of the test assemblies.

        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.
3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.
4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE

        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.
3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.
4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE
4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,

        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.
        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.
3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.
4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE
4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,
the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the
specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements.
4.2   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of any
inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformance
does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.

3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.

        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.
3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.
4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE
4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,
the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the

4.2   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of any
inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformance
does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.
4.3   Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders)  Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during
the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies.

3.2   Marking - Unless marking requirements are specified by a document or drawing cited in this solicitation all items delivered under this contract/purchase order shall be marked and identified in accordance with the applicable Military Standards and
Specifications as follows:
       Mechanical Parts, Assemblies and Equipments - MIL-STD-130
       Electrical and Electronic Parts - MIL-STD-1285, Method 1.

       Electronic Equipment - MIL-STD-454 Requirement Number 67.
       Electrical Equipment - MIL-P-15024/5 (SHIPS)
3.3   Source Control Item - Previous delivery of the specified National Stock Number or similar item manufactured to technical procurement specifications and/or drawings supplied by a Government activity or Price Contractor does not in itself qualify a supplier
as a Government approved source.  Only those sources for this item previously approved by the Government have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new supplier is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of the new source.
       If you have not been solicited and you can furnish either (a) proof of your prior approval as a supplier of this item, or (b) data showing you have produced the same or similar items satisfactorily for the Government or a commercial source, or (c) test
data indicating your product can meet service operating requirements, or (d) other pertinent data concerning your qualificatin to produce the required item, notify the Procurement Contracting Officer in writing, furnishing said proof of data for evaluation
possibly leading to your firm being authorized as an approved source for this procurement or subsequent procurements.
3.4   Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated.  The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973,
Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D.  Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E.  Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E.  (Original
and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa.  17055-0788.)
3.5   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (76 degrees F +/- 10 degrees F). Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.
4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE
4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchause order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase
order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection reqiurements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in
the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed reqiurements.
4.2   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of any
inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformance
does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.
4.3   Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies.
5.  PACKAGING

3.7.1   Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until
another drawing revision is approved.  The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted,
the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority.
        Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below.
        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.
        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.
3.8   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.

Section C - Specifications
Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or ""user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information"" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.
Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts. CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.
For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification. This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended. FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012
Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)
DoD policy: adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems. Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.
Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.Information SafeguardsUnclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:
a. Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) b. Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)
c. Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)
It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system. However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:a. Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)
b. Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.
c. At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.
d. Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.
e. Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.f. Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)
g. Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.h. Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.
i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)
j. Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:(1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.(2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.
(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.
k. Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.
l. Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.
m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.
Operations Security
Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information: facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.
Critical information includes information regarding:
- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;- Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;- Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;- Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and- Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.
The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:- Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;- During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.&emsp;Section G 252.232-7003252.232-7006

Future orders will be competed among existing BOA holders at the time of the Request for Proposal (RFP). A BOA is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term; (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided; (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. A BOA is not a contract. Orders issued under BOAs are the binding contractual actions, and each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. The Contracting Officer will advertise the BOA through the Federal Business Opportunities website annually, to maximize competition for the duration of the effort.
Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price/cost proposals leading to the award of orders. Future orders may be competed based on a Low Price Technically Acceptable or Best Value basis. Specific firm-fixed-price and cost reimbursement orders will be competed among the BOA holders. In order to receive a cost-type order, a contractor must have a Government approved accounting system prior to issuance of RFP.
Issuance of BOA's will be based on the government's evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in this notice.
&bull; Company's Capabilities Statement&bull; APSD Approved Vendor Email&bull; AS9100 Certificate
The Government reserves the right to set-aside future BOA orders for small businesses contractors when practicable.
The Government reserves the right not to issue a BOA to a contractor who fails to meet the above stated criteria. BOAs will be issued for a period of five years. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOAs. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such an obligation. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, NAWCAD may continue to place orders under the BOA. Contractors must have representations and certifications registered on the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov.
All questions and submissions in reference to this notice will be sent to the Point of Contact for this requirement, William Waterhouse, 732-323-2243; william.waterhouse@navy.mil

No telephone calls will be accepted. Noun: Bell Crank (AH-64 D/E). This effort is for a one year contract for maintenance and overhaul of Input NSNs/PN: 1560-01-242-1495/7-311511123-17; Output NSN/PN: 1560-01-242-1495/7-311511123-17. Authority and Justification for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The proposed procurement is for services and supplies which cannot be obtained through full and open competition because only one responsible source is capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements, FAR 6.302-1. Depot Maintenance Work Requirement (DMWR) 1-1520-238 is adequate to support the overhaul of the Bell Crank; however, because this item is a Critical Safety Item (CSI) overhaul can only be performed by an approved source. Pursuant to the provision of Public Law No. 108-136, National Defense Authorization Act Fiscal Year 204, Section 802, Quality Control in Procurement of Aviation Critical Safety Items are Related Services, as implemented for acquisition by Department of Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplement 209-270, contracts for modification, repair or overhaul of CSI items can only be awarded to a source approved by the head of the design control activity, AED. The approved sources of overhaul are: Moog Inc. (CAGE 0UES3) 159 8 Ave NW, West Fargo, ND, 58078-1047 and PCX Aerostructures, LLC (CAGE 82001) 300 Fenn Rd., Newington, CT 06111-2277. These vendors are the only known sources capable of performing this work in the timeframe required to satisfy the Army's minimum needs. All interested sources must meet pre-qualification requirements in order to be eligible for award. To obtain approval, vendors must submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package, for review and approval, to the Engineering Directorate (ED) Quality Engineering Division. Source approval must be obtained prior to being considered for contract award. Approvals are made on an individual part number basis for a specific manufacturing location (CAGE). Firms are encouraged to seek source approval in order to compete for future solicitations by following the SAR submission guidance provided on the website: http://amcomdmz.redstone.army.mil/casl_cmo/casldba.casl_cmo_samsar. Questions concerning SAR submissions can be directed to the ED SAR Team at EDSAR@amrdec.army.mil or call the SAR Team at 256-313-8978, 256-313-0341 or 256-313-8994. The closing date annotated is an estimated date for interested vendors, a pre-solicitation notice will be published on or about 16 May 2017 and may be adjusted dependent upon the date of release of solicitation, however; the solicitation will not close prior to the closing date stated on the solicitation. Foreign firms are reminded that all requests for solicitation must be processed through their respective embassies. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.",ACC Redstone,2017-05-02 15:06:31+00:00,2017-05-02,2017-05-17 04:59:59+00:00,2017-05-17,,Sources Sought,,336413,Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing ,16,Aerospace Craft Components And Accessories,,Adam Taylor Mountain,adam.t.mountain.civ@mail.mil,2569559294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2100,W58RGZ,W6QK ACC-RSA,8384d22a2a4ab88f10a3b0322a6df030,PI33_DR_IAE_51681,adam.t.mountain.civ@mail.mil,2017-05-31 08:40:12+00:00,2017-05-02 15:06:31+00:00,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/W58RGZ-17-R-0217-Sources_Sought-df030,https://sam.gov/opp/8384d22a2a4ab88f10a3b0322a6df030/view

21df98e9f43f14fffbd13267a76bb0c5,W909MY-16-R-H015,Aerial and Ground Intelligence Sensor Simulation,"The US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is seeking sources on behalf of Communications-Electronics, Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Night Vision and Electronics Sensors Directorate (NVESD) for Engineering Support and Modeling &amp; Simulation of Sensors Applications in support of DoD and US Intelligence agency services to support advanced modeling and simulation for aerial and ground intelligence collection sensors simulations in support of sustainment training and new equipment training.Support is needed for advanced, physics-based sensor simulation technology development for Electro Optic Infra-Red (EO/IR all spectrums), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and multi intelligence collection systems that are developed or in development. Advanced development of tactics techniques and procedures (TTP), systems analysis, system test and evaluation, system modeling and simulation, as well as sustainment and new equipment training in the focus areas of Sensors and Sensor Systems platforms for aerial and ground intelligence collection systems. The Contractor will be required to have a TOP Secret facility clearance and TOP Secret safeguarding requirements.
The services and support described herein are intended to maximize the operational capability and efficiency of NVESD by providing personnel with the necessary skill levels and expertise to support the Government in conducting research, development and administrative efforts related to modeling and simulation of sensors. The services and support described herein are not limited to the longer term research, development and administrative efforts but also include quick reaction support services and material directly related to NVESD efforts to provide rapid technology solutions to the Warfighters to address urgent current/future mission needs related to conflicts and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Assistance is needed for Modeling and Simulation Division developed Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) models in a live, virtual and constructive (LVC) simulation environment where these simulation applications are used to support sensor technology development, concept exploration, system integration, potential test and evaluation phase, production of releasable hardware, and planned support of sensor-based systems for the US Army and other DOD organizations. The use of these modeling and simulation applications provides a realistic approach to using future hardware in theatre. These simulation applications are expected to provide a close replication of human interaction, direct the development of engineering design alternatives, allow users to evaluate new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP), and participate in a virtual environment for Joint and Army LVC experiments as well as transition technologies and systems that show the most potential for enhancing the lethality and survivability capabilities of the Warfighter and wounded warriors. Additionally, sensor systems for future US Army and other Department of Defense (DOD) customers need to be engineered, a prototype constructed and tested and eventually expanded into a Program of Record needing oversight, systems engineering, logistical and sustainment support.
