Definitions: TSATC - Transportation Security Administration Training Center located on the Federal Aviation Administration&rsquo;s William J. Hughes Technical Center in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. The TSATC is comprised of 13 buildings, however only the Multipurpose Training Building, commonly known as Building 360, has Aircraft Cabin Training Simulators (ACTS) in it.

Building 360 &ndash; this is the Building number assigned by the FAA to the Transportation Security Administration Training Center (TSATC) Multipurpose Training Building, which houses all of the aircraft simulators. This is also the common name of the building amongst staff and Contractors. The building is a clear-span-purlin-type pre-engineered 30,000sqft building, approximately half of which is completely open. This open area referred is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;High Bay Area&rdquo; which houses all of the Aircraft Cabin Training simulators.

High Bay Area &ndash; Common name for a 15,000sqft room within Building 360 which houses all of the Aircraft Cabin Training Simulators (ACTS).

ACTS &ndash; Aircraft Cabin Training Simulator, general term for aircraft simulator

Platform I &ndash; an ACTS that simulates a 767 aircraft with the addition of a staircase mid-ship that leads to an upper deck. Although the staircase and upper deck was not typical on real 767 aircraft, this ACTS design allowed TSA to simulate both 767 and 747 configurations within the same footprint. The design of Platform I used substantial structure steel members to support the Platform II ACTS above it. This ACTS is approximately 99ft in length.

Platform II &ndash; an ACTS that simulates a 747 upper deck. The Platform II was originally installed on top of the Platform I to form a single ACTS that could be used as a 747 trainer, a 767 trainer, or both simultaneously. This ACTS is approximately 70ft in length.

Platform V - an ACTS that simulates a 767 aircraft cabin only. There is no flight deck in this simulator. This ACTS did not have the robust features that other ACTS at the TSATC have and was designed and constructed for field use throughout the country. There are roughly 14 Platform V ACTS in use throughout the country and all were designed and built similarly. This ACTS is approximately 51ft in length.

ACY &ndash; is the airport identifier for the Atlantic City International Airport. The TSATC is located adjacent to the Atlantic City International Airport and therefor the term ACY is sometimes used to describe the TSATC as other TSA locations are often described by the airport identifier they are located closest to.

Instructor Operating Station (IOS) &ndash; This is the console where the simulators are controlled from. Each IOS contains a touchscreen device where the functions of the simulator can be operated, as well as control buttons, a master key-switch and a DVR.

DVR &ndash; Digital Video Recorder, a device that records video from camera inputs and saves the video to a hard drive in a format that can be searched by time, date, or motion and exported in standardized video formats if necessary.

CO- Contracting Officer. An individual warranted and authorized by the head of a Federal agency to enter into a contract with an entity.

COR - Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative. Ensure that Contractors meet the commitment of their contracts. They ensure proper development of requirements and assist Contracting Officers in managing their contracts

Execution of Work:

Phase I- The Contractor shall be responsible for all labor, material and equipment necessary to make all preparations, physical and logical, to the existing Aircraft Cabin Training Simulators (ACTS) and the Facility (Building 360) to receive the other phases and aspects of this project as outlined elsewhere.

bb9239bac9a57d9df975d97404276e70,FA8625-15-C-6599 ,Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization," 
The Government intends to solicit and award a sole source contract modification to The Boeing Company for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities for the VC-25B Program. The purpose of EMD is to complete detailed design, modification, test and fielding of two aircraft which will provide Presidential worldwide airlift support starting in the 2024 timeframe. The Amendment 01 to the  Request for Proposal (RFP) is attached to this announcement. The Justification and Approval in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 ""Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements,"" dated 23 Feb 2015 can be accessed at: https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=cd8446bfe8695d18e65dc3b6ce5e003d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1
The original request for proposal is based upon original authorization received from Mr. Frank Kendall, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, continuing a deliberate, step-by-step approach to reduce program and cost risk. Previous contract actions were issued for engineering risk reduction studies concentrated in specific technical areas of future design and integration work and Preliminary Design.  Most notably were studies on the layout of passenger accommodations, system specification, the environmental control system, the aircraft interior, and the electrical and power system, as well as other areas to ensure completion of presidential missions.  This data will greatly influence the aircraft design and will lead to a lower risk Engineering and Manufacturing Development program.
The scope of this effort includes the modification by Boeing to the already-Federal Aviation Administration certified Boeing 747-8 aircraft to meet presidential operational requirements.  The modifications to the 747-8 aircraft will include electrical power upgrades, a mission communication system, a medical facility, executive interior, a self-defense system, and autonomous ground operations capabilities. Respondents to this solicitation are requested to submit a capability statement or proposal by the Response Date listed in this notice. For more information on the VC-25B requirements, please refer to the attachments, the Presolicitation Notice posted on 28 Jan 2015, the RFP Notice posted on 12 Sep 2016, and the Sources Sought Synopsis posted on 9 Sep 2013, the latter of which can be accessed at: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=904b9445a58553ade5cee5251cb9a41c&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1 All responses to the Presolicitation Notice and the Sources Sought Synopsis were carefully considered and extensive market research was conducted.Any proposals will be fully evaluated by this office before award of a sole source contract modification.

This actual contract award number is FA8625-16-C-6599 P00011.
 
The Boeing Company (Boeing) has been awarded a cost plus award fee contract modification for Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) Program preliminary design activities. This contract action will allow Boeing to complete preliminary design work for the modification of two 747-8 aircraft to replace the two aging VC-25A (Boeing 747-200) Presidential support aircraft. The resultant modification to the aircraft (to be negotiated in a future contract modification) will include incorporating a mission communications system, electrical power upgrades, a medical facility, an executive interior, a self-defense system, and autonomous ground operations capabilities.
 
This contract modification is being awarded on a sole-source basis. As the designer and manufacturer of the commercial 747-8 aircraft, Boeing has the unique capability to perform necessary tasks to provide a Presidential aircraft. Boeing is also uniquely-capable of satisfying all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification requirements with the highest confidence to meet the established program operational need date. This unique capability is based on Boeing's exclusive private development of the aircraft and sole ownership of the 747-8 aircraft stress, loads, and aerodynamic design data. Boeing declined to sell or otherwise provide the United States Government, or other contractors, with the license rights needed to conduct an adequate competition, or to provide additional engineering services in lieu of data rights.
 
Without access to Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) technical data and support, a non-OEM would face significant challenges in securing required FAA Supplemental Type Certificates when attempting the extensive modifications needed for Boeing 747-8 aircraft to meet PAR Program requirements. Without the OEM's technical data and support, a non-OEM would be responsible for generating and recreating basic aircraft technical design data. The FAA would require a significant amount of proof in terms of data development, compliance methodology, and reverse-engineering type design data needed to substantiate and certify the modifications required for the PAR Program. Non-OEM reverse engineering type design data introduces significant cost and schedule risk into this program, which would jeopardize achieving an initial operating capability by 2024.",AFLCMC Wright Patterson AFB,2017-09-13 21:20:07+00:00,2017-09-13,,,,Award Notice,,336411,Aircraft Manufacturing ,15,Aerospace Craft And Structural Components,Contract Specialist,Mark D.

Non-OEM reverse engineering type design data introduces significant cost and schedule risk into this program, which would jeopardize having an initial operational capability by 2024.

b47a81ed135b89d24bbdf3a1f1242fee,FA8625-15-C-6599 ,Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization,"  
The Boeing Co., Seattle, Washington, has been awarded a $127,300,000 modification to previously awarded contract FA8625-16-C-6599 for Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization Program Pre-Milestone B Activities Phase 2. This modification is another step in a deliberate process to control program risk and life cycle costs. The contractor will conduct risk reduction activities needed to address PAR sustainment requirements and costs that are additional to those initially awarded on Jan. 29, 2016. These activities will most notably focus on the system specification, the environmental control system, the aircraft interior, the electrical and power system and sustainment and maintenance approaches. They will aid in further defining detailed requirements and design trade-offs required to support informed decisions that will lead to a lower risk engineering and manufacturing development program and lower life cycle costs. 
 
This contract is being awarded on a sole-source basis. As the designer and manufacturer of the commercial 747-8 aircraft, The Boeing Company has the unique capability to perform necessary tasks to provide a Presidential aircraft. Boeing is also uniquely capable of satisfying all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification requirements with the highest confidence to meet the established program operational need date. This unique capability is based on Boeing's exclusively private development of the aircraft and sole ownership of the 747-8 aircraft stress, loads, and aero design data. Boeing declined to sell or otherwise provide the United States Government or other contractors the license rights needed to conduct an adequate competition or to provide additional engineering services in lieu of data rights.
 
The nature of the effort needed to meet PAR Program requirements is such that a non-Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) attempting the extensive modifications required for a Boeing 747-8 aircraft to meet PAR Program requirements would face significant challenges in securing required FAA Supplemental Type Certificates (STC) without availability of OEM technical data and technical support. Without the OEM's technical data and technical support, a non-OEM would be responsible for generating and recreating basic aircraft technical design data. The FAA would require a significant amount of proof in terms of data development, compliance methodology, and reverse engineering type design data needed to substantiate and certify the modifications required for the PAR Program.
