Specification 

The PSL J-57 replacement fuel liquid valve must satisfy the following:

      &bull;  Flow of 52 Gallons Per Minute

      &bull;  Flow measurement and accuracy of 3% of reading of 0.5% or full scale

      &bull;  Built in position sensor

      &bull;  Must be failsafe closed

      &bull;  Fuel demand input of 4-20mA

      &bull;  4-20mA Flow feedback

      &bull;  4-20mA Position Feedback

      &bull;  RS232 Communication

      &bull;  Compatible with Jet A

      &bull;  Certified for Class 1, Div. 1&amp;2, Group D:T4



Deliverables

     1 .Liquid Fuel Valve as specified above with &ldquo;-12&rdquo; connections.

Periodic LOTO system evaluations to each VISN 1 medical center listed in Section V paragraph E of this document either biennially or annually which will be determined by each medical center at the task order level.  The evaluation will consist of 5 parts:
a review of the medical center policy (MCP) and standard operating procedures (SOP),
a review of the inventory of written LOTO procedures,
an evaluation of a sampling of the facility s LOTO system,
an assessment of the authorized employees  LOTO system knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA).

Background: In FY21 and FY22, VISN 1 executed a contract to inventory equipment requiring Lockout or Tagout, write LOTO procedures for approximately 3500 pieces of equipment, provided training, and supply all necessary LOTO devices.  In FY23, VISN 1 wrote a LOTO Policy and produced a Network SOP.  The VISN Policy, SOP, and written procedures defined a LOTO system with which each medical center will comply.
Objectives: this BPA provides for periodic evaluations of each facility s LOTO system based on the VISN LOTO SOP and Policy, and applicable sections of 29 CFR 1910 and 1926; compliant LOTO training to each medical center listed in Section V paragraph E of this document; and LOTO procedures writing services.

6. Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if they determine that the circumstances of contract action deem only one source reasonably available:

Check the appropriate reason below:

XXX Brand Name Mandatory

7. Impact Statement

SODECA S.A. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the Centrifugal Fans currently in use providing exhaust ventilation on the 154&rsquo; WPC patrol vessels galley. This contract is intended to enable the Coast Guard to keep these vessels at their original operating capability, current mission requirements and maintain configuration/logistics control. Working in partnership with the OEM distributor is in the best interest of the Coast Guard. The Centrifugal Fans must conform to design, size, materials, configuration, and operational requirements as well as be electrically compatible with the existing electrical system on board the 154&rsquo; WPC patrol vessels. The Centrifugal Fans when in operation provide outside air to exchange with the existing air in the vessel maintaining a steady flow of fresh air and positive pressure throughout the vessel. This system provides fresh air for the crew and well as keeping positive pressure inside the vessel keeping unwanted engine exhaust out of the vessel allowing for proper engine operation. The 154&rsquo; patrol boats have been in service for over 5 years and routinely operate in bad weather and heavy sea state conditions during the course of their multi-mission operations in support of Homeland Security in international and territorial waters. These missions include search and rescue, law enforcement, migrant interdiction, drug enforcement and human trafficking prevention. The SODECA S.A. Fans identified in this acquisition were designed and tested to meet manufacturer requirements and specifications when the vessels were built. A failure of the Centrifugal Fans during vessel operations could cause personal injury as well as reduced engine efficiency and power, electrical overloading, crew discomfort due to stale air, mold growth or electrical fire. Any reduction of engine efficiency or failure of electrical power will cause a multitude of other very serious problems. Any failure of substituted or aftermarket parts could delay mission response, jeopardize the safety of the vessel and crew possibly causing loss of life, property or damage to the environment. The reliability of the SODECA A.S. Centrifugal Fans is known and acceptable; they have met Coast Guard mission requirements and safety standards through several years of unrestricted use and thousands of operational hours. Determining the equivalency of any non- SODECA S.A. Centrifugal Fans will require operational testing, design reviews and possible system/sub-system re-engineering to determine their suitability. This effort will require costs that would be diverted from other logistics elements which would then impact other support areas for the 154&rsquo; WPC fleet. Failing to perform these additional efforts and accepting without evaluation so called equivalent Centrifugal Fans is unacceptable and may result in potential personal injuries, reduced reliability, reduced safety, increased maintainability and increased logistical costs which will impact future Coast Guard Mission requirements.

8. Explain why an adequate purchase description or other information suitable to solicit by Full and Open Competition has not been developed or are not suitable. 

All reproduction manufacturing drawings, specifications, and other technical data pertaining to the Centrifugal Fans were not purchased when these Vessels were purchased by the Coast Guard and are not available for use by the Coast Guard now. The Coast Guard does not possess manufacturing data required to obtain full and open competition. Further, the scope of manufacturing, special tools and equipment required to manufacture the Centrifugal Fans are unknown. The technical data that is needed is proprietary. Without the adequate data, the Coast Guard is not capable of evaluating equal or alternate parts  manufactured by other than the OEM. The use of OEM parts will insure components and processes are sufficient to enable physical and functional interchangeability, as well as identifying source, size, configuration and performance requirements. Vendors other than the OEM shall provide documentation certifying parts provided meet SODECA S. A. standards and specifications as they pertain the Coast Guard 154&rsquo; WPC vessel application. 

9. Provide a Statement of Actions, if any, the government may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before future acquisitions are required.

Due to the fact the Coast Guard does not own the required drawings, specifications, technical data etc. to evaluate other than the OEM Centrifugal Fans and it is unlikely SODECA S.A. will sell the data rights to the Coast Guard, it is not anticipated that any future requirements will be full and open competition. The Coast Guard cannot force any OEM to release proprietary information and it is unlikely the Coast Guard will have the required funding to purchase such rights if they were offered by SODECA S.A. or have the Centrifugal Fans reverse engineered. However, every attempt will be made to obtain the applicable drawings, specifications, etc. from the OEM before any subsequent acquisitions occur. The COR will engage the Coast Guard SFLC Patrol Boat Product Line (PBPL) command to request funding to reverse engineer the Centrifugal Fans or to obtain drawings that can be used for manufacture.

Therefore, Collins Aerospace is the only source that can provide engineering and logistics support for maintenance of the T56-A-427A engine FPMU and PCMU LRU components. The U.S. Navy does not have the technical data and data rights necessary to conduct a competition. Collins Aerospace is unwilling to sell the data rights to the Government. Award to any source other than Collins Aerospace for each of the requirements listed above would unacceptably delay the E-2 mission. The time to run a full and open competition, have a new source complete the design efforts, set up production equipment, fabricate and qualify new hardware/software would unduly delay the fulfillment of these critical requirements by approximately five years. As E-2 are currently in-theater, delays such as those described above would significantly reduce the operational effectiveness of these platforms. These additional delays will result in missing required aircraft modification/retrofit installs on the aircraft going through Depot-Level Planned Maintenance Intervals (PMIs) resulting in grounding aircraft, thus significantly impacting fleet readiness. Therefore, the Government has determined that Collins Aerospace is the only responsible source capable of providing supplies and/or services without an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Government&#39;s requirement.The BOA will be available for issuing orders for a period of five (5) years.
