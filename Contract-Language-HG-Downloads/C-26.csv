The CMMARS follow-on contract vehicle will be used by several Government entities such as Naval Fleet activities, and NAVAIR Program Offices.  Non-Navy customers will also be able to use the established contract vehicle.  The COMFRC Acquisition Group will support Government customers in the development of acquisition documentation, requirements development, Requests for Proposals (RFPs), conduct of source selections, retention and the use of lessons learned.  The COMFRC Acquisition Group has two primary goals: improving the quality of contracted services and shortening the procurement lead time to award.

Contracted Maintenance, Modification, Aircrew, and Related Services (CMMARS) Follow-On

**This RFI includes multiple North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. Interested businesses can provide one consolidated response.**

The CMMARS follow-on contract vehicle will be used by several Government entities such as Naval Fleet activities, and NAVAIR Program Offices.  Non-Navy customers will also be able to use the established contract vehicle.  The COMFRC Acquisition Group will support Government customers in the development of acquisition documentation, requirements development, Requests for Proposals (RFPs), conduct of source selections, retention and the use of lessons learned.  The COMFRC Acquisition Group has two primary goals: improving the quality of contracted services and shortening the procurement lead time to award.

This is the first RFI issued for planning purposes for the CMMARS Follow-on contract.  Both large and small businesses are encouraged to respond.

The CMMARS follow-on will be a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The CMMARS follow-on MAC and associated task orders will be used to procure CLS for maintenance, modification, aircrew and related services for aviation platforms and associated equipment.  Additionally, the CMMARS follow-on MAC will be used for heavy depot maintenance requirements and workload to augment the organic capabilities of the depots. 

The Government plans to award the CMMARS follow-on under one or more of the following NAICS Codes: 488190: Aircraft ferrying services, aircraft inspection services, aircraft maintenance and repair services (except factory conversion, factory overhaul, factory rebuilding), aircraft testing services, fueling aircraft on a contract or fee basis, independent pilot, air (except owner-operators), inspection services, aircraft testing services;  336411:  Aircraft Manufacturing (manufacturing or assembling complete aircraft; developing and making aircraft prototypes; aircraft conversion (i.e., major modifications to systems); and complete aircraft overhaul and rebuilding (i.e., periodic restoration of aircraft to approved design specifications); 336412:  Aircraft engine repair/overhaul, Aircraft engine rebuilding; and 336413:  Aircraft Propeller repair/overhaul and Aircraft Landing Gear repair/overhaul.

Therefore, FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements) is the authority under which sole source will be used. Leonardo is the only company that has the technical support to the Vixen 500 AESA Radar. This radar system has specific components such as the antenna, processor, power supply, navigation unit, liquid cooling unit and inertial measurement unit (IMU) that can be procured from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or repaired by an authorized vendor.  Leonardo has the required technical data and specialized test equipment to evaluate, troubleshoot, repair and calibrate the Vixen 500 radar components. With Leonardo being the OEM, they can provide technical support to the US Navy Test Pilot School to include access to replacement parts on the Vixen 500 radar.  This agreement benefits the Government because as Leonardo is the OEM, it is critical that the radar system be maintained to support the test pilot school to ensure test pilot students complete their training syllabus to become qualified Test Pilots, Test Flight Officers and Test Project Engineers. Under FAR 6.302-1, Leonardo is the only source that has the technical data, knowledge, experience, and capability necessary to fulfill the Government's need and meet its requirements within the defined schedule.
