This sources sought is being issued by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR).  The Navy E-6B Program Office (PMA-271) is seeking the procurement of a single Boeing 707-320 series aircraft to be used as an in-flight trainer for the E-6B program.

This sources sought is being used as a market research tool pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10 to determine potential sources and their technical capabilities.  The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code currently assigned to this procurement is 336411.

DISCLAIMER

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

2.  BACKGROUND

The E-6B is integral to U.S. nuclear command, control, and communications (C3) system, and provides assured capability for U.S. nuclear force execution. Currently, the U.S. Navy conducts all initial and recurring E-6B pilot training flight in E-6B mission aircraft. These training flights expose mission aircraft to significant unnecessary wear-and-tear and negatively impact E-6B readiness and availability. Moreover, lack of a dedicated training aircraft increases the time required to train qualified aircrews needed to execute the E-6B mission. The purchase of an in-flight trainer aircraft will result in the reduction of 600 flight hours and 2400 landings/cycles per year from the E-6B mission aircraft.

3.  INFORMATION REQUESTED 

NAVAIR is conducting market research to identify the availability of a suitable aircraft to be used as a trainer for the E-6B mission aircraft. In order to be considered suitable, the aircraft would need to be a Boeing 707-320 type aircraft. The aircraft needs to be fitted with CFM-56 engines, capable of in-flight refueling using the USAF boom refueling method, and have sufficient service life (hours and cycles) remaining in order to remain in service through 2038. The planned usage for the trainer aircraft is 600 hours and 2400 landing/cycles per year. As a standard for determining fatigue life remaining, we will assess possible aircraft using the Federal Aviation Administration&rsquo;s (FAA) Limit of Validity (LOV).  The LOV for the 707 has been set by the FAA at 20,000 cycles. If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance.  Please do not include company brochures or other marketing type information.  Include the following:

Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) 
for Flight Crew and Mission Crew Training and Support
CAUTION: 
The Joint STARS Program Office is seeking responsible sources for the execution and administration of a comprehensive training program for Flight Crew and Mission Crew Training (FCT/MCT) for the E-8 weapon system. E-8 Flight Crew and Mission Crew Training consist of academic and training device instruction in support of Qualification Training (QT), Upgrade Training (UGT), Cross-Training (XT), Requalification Training (RQ), Senior Officer Course (SOC), and Integrated Release (IR) Difference Training (DT), as well as courseware development and maintenance and web-based training. Training requirements for the wing are based on Programmed Flying Training (PFT) established by the Combat Air Forces (CAF).
Contractors/Institutions responding to this request for information/market survey are notified participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse respondents for any expenses associated with their participation in the request for information/market survey.
BACKGROUND:
The E-8 is a modified Boeing 707-300 series commercial airframe extensively re-manufactured and modified with the radar, communications, operations and control sub-systems required to perform its operational mission. The most prominent external feature is the 27-foot (8 meters) long, canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage housing the 24-foot (7.3 meters) long, side-looking phased array antenna.
The radar and computer sub-systems on the E-8C can gather and display detailed battlefield information on ground forces. The information is relayed in near real-time to the Army and Marine Corps common ground stations and to other ground command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence, or C4I, nodes.
The antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft where it can develop a 120-degree field of view covering nearly 19,305 square miles (50,000 square kilometers) and is capable of detecting targets at more than 250 kilometers (more than 820,000 feet). The radar also has some limited capability to detect helicopters, rotating antennas and low, slow-moving fixed wing aircraft.
As a battle management and command and control asset, the E-8C can support the full spectrum of roles and missions from peacekeeping operations to major theater war.
Joint STARS evolved from Army and Air Force programs to develop, detect, locate, and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. The first two developmental aircraft deployed in 1991 to Operation Desert Storm and also supported Operation Joint Endeavor in December 1995.
Team Joint STARS men and women have contributed tremendously to overseas contingency operations, flying more than 130,000 combat hours in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn, Unified Protector, Freedom's Sentinel, and Inherent Resolve. Their operational resume includes support of six Combatant Commands including U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Africa Command, and U.S. Europe Command.
Team Joint STARS was the first organization in the USAF to activate under the Air Force's Total Force Initiative as a ""blended"" wing. America's first ""Total Force"" wing, the former 93rd Air Control Wing, an active-duty Air Combat Command unit, and the 116th Bomb Wing, a Georgia Air National Guard unit, were deactivated Oct.1, 2002. The 116th Air Control Wing was activated blending Guard and active-duty Airmen into a single unit. In October 2011, the Active Associate construct was formed by the newly activated 461st Air Control Wing as a member of Team Joint STARS.
Team Joint STARS through the 116th/461st ACW, is the only unit operating the E-8C and conducting the Joint STARS mission.

Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) 
For Contractor Field Service Representatives (CFSRs)
CAUTION: 
The Joint STARS Program Office is seeking responsible sources for CFSR support and services for the E-8 weapon system for Continental United States (CONUS) and on occasion, outside CONUS (OCONUS).
Contractors/Institutions responding to this request for information/market survey are notified participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse respondents for any expenses associated with their participation in the request for information/market survey.
BACKGROUND:
The E-8 is a modified Boeing 707-300 series commercial airframe extensively re-manufactured and modified with the radar, communications, operations and control sub-systems required to perform its operational mission. The most prominent external feature is the 27-foot (8 meters) long, canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage housing the 24-foot (7.3 meters) long, side-looking phased array antenna.
The radar and computer sub-systems on the E-8C can gather and display detailed battlefield information on ground forces. The information is relayed in near real-time to the Army and Marine Corps common ground stations and to other ground command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence, or C4I, nodes.
The antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft where it can develop a 120-degree field of view covering nearly 19,305 square miles (50,000 square kilometers) and is capable of detecting targets at more than 250 kilometers (more than 820,000 feet). The radar also has some limited capability to detect helicopters, rotating antennas and low, slow-moving fixed wing aircraft.
As a battle management and command and control asset, the E-8C can support the full spectrum of roles and missions from peacekeeping operations to major theater war.
Joint STARS evolved from Army and Air Force programs to develop, detect, locate, and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. The first two developmental aircraft deployed in 1991 to Operation Desert Storm and also supported Operation Joint Endeavor in December 1995.
Team Joint STARS men and women have contributed tremendously to overseas contingency operations, flying more than 130,000 combat hours in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn, Unified Protector, Freedom's Sentinel, and Inherent Resolve. Their operational resume includes support of six Combatant Commands including U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Africa Command, and U.S. Europe Command.
Team Joint STARS was the first organization in the USAF to activate under the Air Force's Total Force Initiative as a ""blended"" wing. America's first ""Total Force"" wing, the former 93rd Air Control Wing, an active-duty Air Combat Command unit, and the 116th Bomb Wing, a Georgia Air National Guard unit, were deactivated Oct.1, 2002. The 116th Air Control Wing was activated blending Guard and active-duty Airmen into a single unit. In October 2011, the Active Associate construct was formed by the newly activated 461st Air Control Wing as a member of Team Joint STARS.
Team Joint STARS through the 116th/461st ACW, is the only unit operating the E-8C and conducting the Joint STARS mission.

BACKGROUND:
The E-8 is a modified Boeing 707-300 series commercial airframe extensively re-manufactured and modified with the radar, communications, operations and control sub-systems required to perform its operational mission. The most prominent external feature is the 27-foot (8 meters) long, canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage housing the 24-foot (7.3 meters) long, side-looking phased array antenna.
The radar and computer sub-systems on the E-8C can gather and display detailed battlefield information on ground forces. The information is relayed in near real-time to the Army and Marine Corps common ground stations and to other ground command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence, or C4I, nodes.
The antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft where it can develop a 120-degree field of view covering nearly 19,305 square miles (50,000 square kilometers) and is capable of detecting targets at more than 250 kilometers (more than 820,000 feet). The radar also has some limited capability to detect helicopters, rotating antennas and low, slow-moving fixed wing aircraft.
As a battle management and command and control asset, the E-8C can support the full spectrum of roles and missions from peacekeeping operations to major theater war.
Joint STARS evolved from Army and Air Force programs to develop, detect, locate, and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. The first two developmental aircraft deployed in 1991 to Operation Desert Storm and also supported Operation Joint Endeavor in December 1995.
Team Joint STARS men and women have contributed tremendously to overseas contingency operations, flying more than 130,000 combat hours in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn, Unified Protector, Freedom's Sentinel, and Inherent Resolve. Their operational resume includes support of six Combatant Commands including U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Africa Command, and U.S. Europe Command.
Team Joint STARS was the first organization in the USAF to activate under the Air Force's Total Force Initiative as a ""blended"" wing. America's first ""Total Force"" wing, the former 93rd Air Control Wing, an active-duty Air Combat Command unit, and the 116th Bomb Wing, a Georgia Air National Guard unit, were deactivated Oct.1, 2002. The 116th Air Control Wing was activated blending Guard and active-duty Airmen into a single unit. In October 2011, the Active Associate construct was formed by the newly activated 461st Air Control Wing as a member of Team Joint STARS.
Team Joint STARS through the 116th/461st ACW, is the only unit operating the E-8C and conducting the Joint STARS mission.

&bull;2.0  Background &amp; Description of Requirement
The E-3 AWACS, operated by the 552nd Air Control Wing at Tinker AFB, OK provides the Combat Air Forces with airborne systems and personnel for theater surveillance, warning and control of strategic, tactical and special mission forces. The AWACS DRAGON program replaces aging, predominantly analog, non-sustainable equipment with modern, digital avionics systems that provide for future growth and enhanced operation, safety and reliability while reducing life cycle costs.  Overall, this program uses a systems approach to aid pilot awareness and alleviate task saturation in high technology flight and combat environments.  The requirement to reduce aircraft separation and implement other Air Traffic Management (ATM) procedures while maintaining or improving safety standards is met by using available aviation technology currently used in commercial and military aircraft.  Essential technology elements of the new Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) environment are satellite-based navigation, increased use of data links for pilot/controller communication, and improved surveillance to enhance flight deck situational awareness.  For the E-3 AWACS aircraft to operate in this new environment, replacement of 1970s vintage analog flight deck equipment with currently available modern digital avionics is required.  
 
DRAGON also replaces existing E-3 AWACS avionics with commercial off the shelf (COTS) avionics to maintain mission readiness being affected by significant Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) impacts and to reduce life-cycle costs by addressing the most significant existing DMSMS issues.
 
The DRAGON Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract was awarded sole source to The Boeing Company where one aircraft was modified with the DRAGON solution.  The majority of the CNS/ATM LRUs consists of an integrated Collins Aerospace commercial type Flight Management System Suite (FMSS).  Though the Boeing 707-320 series aircraft is Boeing proprietary data and the FMSS is Collins Aerospace proprietary, the content of the A-Kits is provided in Attachment 1.
 
DRAGON is currently executing the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) portion of the program where 5 of the 31 aircraft fleet are being modified with DRAGON.  The remainder of the DRAGON modifications will be completed under Full Rate Production, which is currently scheduled for a late FY20 contract award.  
 
The scope of this effort is for the manufacturing and/or procurement of 25 aircraft kits and spares which will require the use of the Technical Data Package which makes up the DRAGON baseline.  Required documentation will be provided in a bidders' library at the time of a draft RFP, if one is issued.  For this RFI, sample drawings and pictures will be provided upon request to help vendors understand the scope of the effort.

CAUTION: 
The Joint STARS Program Office is seeking responsible sources for the acquisition of a follow-on Joint STARS support and sustainment contract for the E-8C aircraft. The current Total System Support Responsibility (TSSR) contract (F09603-00-D-0210) was awarded in 2000 to Northrop Grumman Corporation and is in effect until October of 2022. The follow-on Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be an eight-year effort.
Contractors/Institutions responding to this request for information/market survey are notified participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse respondents for any expenses associated with their participation in the request for information/market survey.
BACKGROUND:
The E-8C is a modified Boeing 707-300 series commercial airframe extensively re-manufactured and modified with the radar, communications, operations and control sub-systems required to perform its operational mission. The most prominent external feature is the 27-foot (8 meters) long, canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage housing the 24-foot (7.3 meters) long, side-looking phased array antenna.
The radar and computer sub-systems on the E-8C can gather and display detailed battlefield information on ground forces. The information is relayed in near real-time to the Army and Marine Corps common ground stations and to other ground command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence, or C4I, nodes.
The antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft where it can develop a 120-degree field of view covering nearly 19,305 square miles (50,000 square kilometers) and is capable of detecting targets at more than 250 kilometers (more than 820,000 feet). The radar also has some limited capability to detect helicopters, rotating antennas and low, slow-moving fixed wing aircraft.
As a battle management and command and control asset, the E-8C can support the full spectrum of roles and missions from peacekeeping operations to major theater war.
Joint STARS evolved from Army and Air Force programs to develop, detect, locate, and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. The first two developmental aircraft deployed in 1991 to Operation Desert Storm and also supported Operation Joint Endeavor in December 1995.
Team Joint STARS men and women have contributed tremendously to overseas contingency operations, flying more than 130,000 combat hours in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn, Unified Protector, Freedom's Sentinel, and Inherent Resolve. Their operational resume includes support of six Combatant Commands including U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Africa Command, and U.S. Europe Command.
Team Joint STARS was the first organization in the USAF to activate under the Air Force's Total Force Initiative as a ""blended"" wing. America's first ""Total Force"" wing, the former 93rd Air Control Wing, an active-duty Air Combat Command unit, and the 116th Bomb Wing, a Georgia Air National Guard unit, were deactivated Oct.1, 2002. The 116th Air Control Wing was activated blending Guard and active-duty Airmen into a single unit. In October 2011, the Active Associate construct was formed by the newly activated 461st Air Control Wing as a member of Team Joint STARS.
Team Joint STARS through the 116th/461st ACW, is the only unit operating the E-8C and conducting the Joint STARS mission.
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
The Joint STARS Program Office is surveying the market to determine those sources qualified to perform work under this effort. The contract is expected to include the following regarding support and sustainment of the E-8C weapon system:
- General program management responsibilities including; planning, organizing, staffing, administering, and controlling all contract activities, and to ensure cost, schedule, and technical objectives are achieved. - Supply chain management of F74 within the constraints mentioned in ""Limitations."" - Diminishing Manufacturing Source and Material Shortages (DMSMS) to include Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RM&amp;A).- Contractor Field Service Representatives (CFSRs) preferably with experience on large military or commercial aircraft, and more specifically, the Boeing 707 variant aircraft.- Execution and administration of a comprehensive Flight Crew and Mission Crew Training program for various aircrew positions and maintenance support for the Mission and Maintenance Trainer (MMT) and the Prime Mission Equipment Maintenance Training Device. This includes computer based training.- Establish and maintain a technical publications program IAW TM 86-01N, Air Force Technical Manual Contract Requirements including; Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) and conversion of current Joint STARS maintenance data to S1000D format. - Engineering support for the E-8C weapon system, including proprietary prime mission equipment.- Software engineering and software maintenance support within the constraints mentioned in ""Limitations."" - Develop and execute cybersecurity program encompassing the functions of; identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover IAW AFI 17-130, Cybersecurity Program Management.
Requirements are outlined within guidance provided by USAF and Department of Defense publications. It is expected the Contractor personnel shall have the necessary technical skills and certifications to meet contract requirements. Interested firms should submit a written product demonstrating how they plan on providing technically compliant solutions for the Joint STARS weapon system during the support and sustainment timeframe listed. If a firm believes it would be competitive in providing necessary support and sustainment capability, then it should submit a product not to exceed 40 pages, with text of 12-font Times New Roman, and graphics should have no smaller than 10-font text. Commercial brochures will not be accepted. Without written permission from the respondent, the Program Office will not release to any firm, agency or individual outside of the Government any information marked ""Proprietary.""
LIMITATIONS:
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and current sole source contractor, has developed a network of sub-contractor repair vendors, many, if not all, trusted sources of exclusive repair developed over 20 plus years. These repair vendors provide support and repair services for Joint STARS unique parts including; Prime Mission Equipment (PME and proprietary to the OEM), aircraft spares, and Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE), all otherwise known as F74. Additionally, software support for the Joint STARS weapon system has been a sole source relationship between AFLCMC/HBGC, 577th SMXG, and the OEM. As the prime integrator for sustainment and mission systems capability upgrades over the last two decades, OEM proprietary software code is evident throughout the E-8C aircraft battle management mission suite of systems. Additionally, the 577th SMXG is projected to provide software sustainment/modernization as the lead organization. They will continue partnering with the OEM for software/radar sustainment and modification until the weapon system is retired.
If prospective vendor believes they could partner with the OEM or overcome the proprietary considerations of the OEM, they should consider providing information regarding support and sustainment of F74 parts and ability to provide software support services.Determination of data rights under consideration.

7595a70324e4d8895e35e409b3ae5cac,N00019-17-RFPREQ-PMA-271-0013,E-6B Aircraft on Ground Unscheduled Maintenance IDIQ Contract," 
Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Sole Source contract to The Boeing Company for the procurement of services in support of unscheduled aircraft maintenance including expertise to rapidly assess damage and/or conduct repairs that are beyond the capability of organizational maintenance personnel.  The E-6B aircraft is a derivative of the Boeing 707 commercial airliner. As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the 707 airframe, Boeing is the only company with the historical design data, drawings, design principles/concepts, and structural strength relationships that are necessary to provide the required analysis support and rapid repair to the E-6B aircraft.  The Contractor shall provide the capacity to evaluate and/or restore aircraft to a flight capable status, or ready the aircraft to safely transit to a Main Operating Base. The Contractor will have the ability to leverage Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved commercial support, maintenance practices and processes for use within the Navy operational infrastructure.
This intended procurement will be processed pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304 (c)(1), whereby the supplies and services required are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Failure to assess/repair required areas will result in a delay to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition as well as failure to comply with Ready for Tasking (RFT) schedule constraints.
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit a capability statement in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 15 July 2016, 1700 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. For subcontracting opportunities, you may contact Barbara Smith at The Boeing Company.
