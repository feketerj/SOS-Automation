Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) is seeking information for market research purposes regarding capabilities to provide supplies and/or services in support of the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS) Low Band Transmitter Antenna Group (LBT-AG), ALQ-99 TJS Low Band Consolidated Antenna Group (LBC-AG), ALQ-99 TJS Band 9/10 Transmitter, Next Generation Jammer &ndash; Lowband (NGJ-LB) Amplifiers, P-8A Poseidon Aircraft ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) Scanner Antenna Unit (SAU), P-8A Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Modified Scanner Antenna Unit (MSAU), ALQ-240 ESM Select Components, and Select Components utilized in the EA-18G Growler Aircraft Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Suite. These electronic warfare systems are installed on the US Navy EA-18G Growler aircraft, P-8A Poseidon aircraft and other EW platforms. Anticipated supplies include but are not limited to: Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRAS), Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAS), sub-SRAS, bit/piece parts, test equipment, and ancillary equipment. Anticipated services include but are not limited to: Engineering and technical support, redesigns, product improvements, upgrades, system and subsystem integration, engineering analyses, documentation (e.g. drawings, data, and software), and repair.

This effort is anticipated to be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 10 U.S.C. &sect; 3204(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NSWC Crane intends to award a Basic Ordering Agreement on a sole source basis to CAES Systems LLC. The basis for restricting competition is because either the Government does not possess the technical data packages or data rights for the above listed subsystems or the duplication of cost/schedule to test another vendor&rsquo;s system for flight use is cost/time prohibitive. CAES Systems LLC is the only contractor possessing the capability to provide the required supplies/services to meet mission requirements without significant duplicative costs and time delays to the Government, which would not be recouped through a competitive contract action.

In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities to enable them to meet the Government&rsquo;s requirements may respond.  Responses shall address technical capabilities to provide the support described herein for each subsystem. All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than five (5) pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, and an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the estimates of duplication of costs and time delays.

Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:

Submitter&rsquo;s Name

Street Address, City, State, Zip Code

Business Size

Point of Contact (POC)

POC Telephone

Announcement Number:  N0016425SNB85

Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.

Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.

At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.

282482-01                         Band B/C RF Distribution Unit

282481-01                        Band A/B/C RF Distribution Unit

The proposed contract action is for the procurement of data for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Argon ST, 12701 Fair Lakes Circle, Suite 800, Fairfax VA 22033, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (statutory authority 10 U.S.C 3204(a)(1)), only one responsible source.

In addition, data procurement from any other vendor would result in extensive duplication of costs to include re-engineering, re-certification, environmental qualifications to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements through any other source. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Shark Marine Technologies Incorporate is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for these systems and has not authorized any other vendor or manufacturer to provide spare or repair parts. The required parts all are proprietary to Shark Marine.  In addition, this configuration of the Shark Navigator has both acoustic and magnetic signatures and trends on file to help inform tactical decisions, and therefore the vendor parts must be used to ensure these signatures do not vary greatly from the trend lines across the systems. EOD teams need confidence in their systems and a set configuration when entering into Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Missions is essential. As the OEM, Shark Marine is the only company with the in-house resident knowledge to accurately provide any consistency in product and parts. An alternate source may introduce new or change existing parameters that may be detrimental to the operation of the Navigator. Therefore, it is imperative that this procurement of repair parts is awarded to Shark Marine immediately so that timely repairs of this vital asset can be performed immediately by Government personnel.

3feed9f14d404580b4f5ce0a502a97a7,AMDTCNOI2502035,Ouster OS2-128 Channel LiDAR,"Introduction
This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation.  A solicitation document will not be issued, and quotations will not be requested.  

Purpose
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed priced purchase order on a brand name only basis with authorized resellers of Ouster, Inc. The purchase order will specifically procure an Ouster OS2-128 Channel LiDAR. Delivery is required within 5 weeks after contractor receipt of order.



Authority
This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of FAR Subpart 11.105 allowing the Contracting Officer (CO) to solicit items peculiar to one manufacturer. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with the small business size standard of 1,350 Employees. 


Description
The NIST Intelligent Systems Division&#39;s (ISD) mission is to advance measurement science for sensing and perception systems, particularly for Automated Vehicle (AV) safety and performance. ISD uses LiDAR for precise object detection and distance measurement for sensor fusion tasks which is crucial for improving AV perception performance. Existing LiDAR resources are insufficient for current ISD research needs resulting in a requirement a new LiDAR resource.



Sole Source Determination
The sole source determination is based on the following:



NIST currently owns and operates an Ouster OS1-32 LiDAR for research purposes. A 128-channel LiDAR is now required for NIST efforts and the new system must interoperate with the existing Ouster system. NIST&rsquo;s research projects which will use the new system were design around the Ouster ROS framework, driver package, and Autoware stack. Other brands of LiDAR will not work with the existing setup which includes a custom rack design around use of Ouster LiDAR technology. Only the Ouster OS2-128 LiDAR is capable of meeting NIST needs. Ouster authorizers resellers; however none of the resellers are small businesses. Therefore, to ensure compatibility with existing research apparatuses, a brand name only competition amongst Ouster authorized resellers is the only appropriate acquisition strategy.



Information for Interested Parties
Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing by or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation.

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Collin Randall, Contract Specialist, at Collin.Randall@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted via email to Collin.Randall@nist.gov so that they are received no later than August 13, 2025, at 10:00 AM, Eastern Time.

53a52d48dc274e7fad77d2108d87779d,140802-25-0654,NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT,"The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson is requesting an 8011M Edge Tech Acoustic Command/Ranging Deck Unit.

This product will be provided by EDGEONE LLC located at 4 Little Brook Road West Wareham, Massachusetts 02576.

NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson deploys and recovers scientific moorings. All moorings utilize EdgeTech hydroacoustic releases, requiring the EdgeTech acoustic command/ranging deck box. New hydroacoustic releases are not designed to work with our current, older model, hydroacoustic command/ranging deck box.  

Currently, both older models and new models of the releases are being used in the field, requiring the new deck box model.  It is the CST&rsquo;s understanding the new deck box model will work with old and new hydroacoustic releases.   

The 8011M Edge Tech Acoustic Command/Ranging Deck Unit properties and engineering design specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by another manufacturer. EDGEONE LLC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the equipment. Therefore, the government intends to negotiate directly with EDGEONE LLC avoiding unnecessary mark ups, delay, warranty, and delivery issues.

The Government is not aware of any other authorized vendors that can provide this specialized equipment while also meeting all of the requirements/concerns listed above. The intended procurement is to acquire one 8011M Edge Tech Acoustic Command/Ranging Deck Unit.

The Government intends to acquire this part under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with EDGEONE LLC. under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with a business size standard of 1350 employees. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any interested party that is an authorized distributor, re-seller, dealer from EDGEONE LLC. and can provide the above requirement, at no additional mark ups, without compromising manufacturing, delivery and warranty may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by August 11, 2025 at 5:00 PM EST. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. 

Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required item, authorized dealer/supplier and availability. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Alexander Cancela at alexander.cancela@noaa.gov by August 11, 2025 at 5pm EST.

0f89aff9159947179ca1b9d260b7c823,N6660420DQ000,N66604-20-D-Q000 SubHDR Repair Contract,"The following notice serves as a request for information (RFI) prepared in accordance with DFARS PGI 206.302-1 and a proposed contract action synopsis prepared in accordance with FAR 5.2 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

This is a synopsis/RFI for an Ordering Period extension modification to Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 awarded on a sole source basis to Raytheon Company (hereafter referred to as &quot;RTX&quot;) on 24 September 2020.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 is 334511; the size standard is 1,350 employees.

Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 is for Testing, Inspection and Evaluation (TI&amp;E), maintenance, repair, upgrade, and restoration or replacement of SubHDR Mast Antenna Lowest Repairable Units (LRUs).

The purpose of the proposed modification is to extend the ordering period from 23 September 2025 to 23 September 2027. This is necessary in order to utilize the remaining ceiling and prevent a gap in services while a follow-on contract is established. The scope of the types of services and supplies and the contract ceiling will remain unchanged. 

For this proposed contract action, the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. As established in Justification &amp; Approval number 17030.1, approved prior to the award of N66604-20-D-Q000, RTX is the only responsible source that has completed functional, performance, and environmental qualifications of the SubHDR MG LRUs and subcomponents.  Due to the complex nature of the SubHDR MG, the environmentally challenging underwater outboard use, and the rigorous certification criteria for SubHDR MGs, LRUs and subcomponents, RTX is the only source that currently possesses the knowledge and expertise required to perform the TI&amp;Es and RUORs.  This ordering period extension modification is required in order to allow for the continued performance of the TI&amp;Es and RUORs. Failure to do so will result in a gap in contractual coverage that will jeopardize continuity of services, program stability, and mission readiness. Additionally, it would also result in unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The place of performance is at the Contractor&rsquo;s site, Marlborough, MA.

The modification is expected to be awarded on or around 23 September 2025.

The synopsis/RFI is not a request for competitive proposals. This requirement is being posted to maximize communication with industry. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not delay award for consideration of capability statements submitted.

Information shall be submitted prior to 13 August 2025 via email to ALL of the following points of contact:

3a6675cb0ef1482aaea64dbdb6eaf2f8,OS2025S3K0051,NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT,"NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT

****THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS***

Requisition No: OS2025S3K0051

Intended Source: MITRE Corporation

Period of performance: 2-years

NAICS Codes:

&bull; 541330: Engineering Services  

Please note: This Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source contract was originally posted on SAM.GOV on or about March 20, 2025, as a 5-year effort.  The Notice of Intent was narrowed down to a 2-year effort instead.

Description of Requirement:

The Department of Transportation, Office of the Secretary intends to award a sole-source Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract award, solicit, and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1).

The intended CPFF contract will be a follow-on for 2-years and is for Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support services operated by The MITRE Corporation (MITRE). This is a new contract based on the current contract, which has a period of performance of August 1, 2025, to July 31, 2027.  The contract is between MITRE and the Department of Transportation, Office of Aviation Analysis (OAA). 

In 1990, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identified and formalized a need for a long-term relationship with an independent research and development entity that would provide essential research and engineering capabilities to support the FAA&#39;s mission. Based on this need, the FAA established an FFRDC. In partnership with the FFRDC, the FAA seeks to provide a safe, secure, and efficient global aviation system that contributes to the national economy, productivity, security, and the promotion of United States aviation interests. The FAA selected MITRE to operate the FFRDC designated as the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD).

In accordance with the definition of a FFRDC described in Part 35.017 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, an FFRDC is uniquely positioned to be able to provide support and guidance in an environment aligned with the needs of the OAA organization and free of competitive pressures because an FFRDC neither competes with private industry nor manufactures hardware products or software. The goal of this contract structure is to provide a contract vehicle that permits objective and independent support, eliminates the administrative costs of annual negotiations, and fosters the required program continuity.

Description of Supplies/Services: In the course of MITRE&rsquo;s long-term relationship with the FAA, MITRE has developed expertise in areas corresponding to the needs of OAA. The FAA Sponsoring Agreement for the operation of CAASD states that CAASD&rsquo;s role includes performance analysis and assessment of national airspace operations and conducting economic, environmental, and policy analysis of impacts on the national airspace system, operators, users, other stakeholders, and the Nation.

Through the proposed contract, the Government will obtain access to CAASD capabilities of specific interest to OAA, including analysis of: (1) Domestic and international aviation industry/markets; (2) Air carrier performance and practices; (3) Regulatory analysis; (4) Cost-benefit analysis; (5) Aviation policy analysis; (6) International trade; (7) Development and application of economic models; (8) Advanced econometrics and discrete choice modeling; (9) Consumer impacts; (10) Computable general equilibrium modeling; (11) Statistical analysis; and (12) Aviation forecasting.

Authority Cited: This action is authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) as implemented by FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), which states that &ldquo;full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award a contract to a particular source in order to&hellip;.establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other non-profit institution or a federally funded research and development center.&rdquo;

Demonstration that the Contractor&rsquo;s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the use of the Authority Cited Above (Applicability of Authority): An FFRDC executes activities that are sponsored under a broad charter by a Government agency for the purpose of performing, analyzing, integrating, supporting, and/or managing basic or applied research and/or development. This contract will be issued pursuant to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Sponsoring Agreement for the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), the FAA&rsquo;s FFRDC.

The role and use of FFRDCs are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (48 CFR 35.017). Specifically, the regulations state that FFRDCs:

&bull;           Exist to meet some special long-term research or development need which cannot be met as effectively by existing in-house or contractor resources.

&bull;           Enable agencies to use private sector resources to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of the sponsoring agency.

&bull;           Have access, beyond that common to normal contractors, to Government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, employees, equipment, and facilities.

&bull;           Must conduct their business in a manner befitting their special relationship with the Government, to operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts, and to have full disclosure of their affairs to the sponsoring agency.

&bull;           Are not intended to use their privileged information or access to compete with the private sector.

Furthermore, an FFRDC is uniquely enabled by the Government to perform work &ldquo;closely associated with inherently governmental functions&rdquo; as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Letter 11-01, Performance of Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions (76 Fed Reg 56227).

In addition, while no requirement exists to obtain competition for the reasons cited in paragraph 4, FAR 35.017-4(a) provides that in reviewing FFRDCs &ldquo;the sponsor, prior to extending the contract or agreement with an FFRDC, shall conduct a Comprehensive Review of the use and need for the FFRDC.&rdquo; The FAA, the sponsoring agent for the CAASD FFRDC, conducted a comprehensive review in FY2020. This review determined that there remains a requirement for an FFRDC and included consideration of alternative sources to meet the sponsor&rsquo;s needs. No additional review is required by the Department of Transportation at this time; the FAA Comprehensive Review has already satisfied this FAR requirement.  Awarding to a company other than MITRE who has already established relationship and proprietary information will cause a delay in services.

DOT will solicit and continue to negotiate directly with MITRE Corporation and no solicitation will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. Offerors must have an active registration in SAM.GOV (SAM) www.sam.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties must express their interest and must be submitted in writing via email to Melinda Riddick at Melinda.Riddick@dot.gov by 12:00 PM, Friday, August 1, 2025 and cc Robin Golden at Robin.Golden@dot.gov. No faxed documents will be accepted. If no responsive statements are received by the due date, an award will be made to The MITRE Corporation.

The Government intends to award a sole source contract to the Raytheon Company (El Segundo, CA) in support of the B-52 Radar Modernization Program (RMP).

AFLCMC/WBD proposes to award by means of other than full and open competition, a sole source contract to the Raytheon Company for the production and sustainment of non-commercial modernized Active Electronically Scanned Array radars that meet the warfighters requirements for the B-52 weapons program.

The authority permitting other than full and open competition is U.S.C.&sect; 3204(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, &ldquo;only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&rdquo;

A sole source contract action is necessary as an award to any other source would likely result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The approved sole source justification will be made available IAW FAR 6.305.

This requirement will fall under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334511 &ndash; Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.

A sole source procurement is anticipated IAW 10 U.S.C.&sect; 3204(a)(1).

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

Moreover, the contractor would lack the methodology history, of which MARC has.

e59c926e06ea4fc781b48a335df5aa7e,N0001922CXXXX,CDS Sustainment - Spares,"NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE This notice is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subparts 5.101 and 5.201 requiring dissemination of information for proposed contract actions. This is a pre-solicitation notice of intent to sole source a contract action and is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1) (formerly 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 &ldquo;Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&rdquo; 

The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) of Arlington, VA, intends to solicit and negotiate a new c-type contract with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (CAGE code 81755) for the purchase of integrated sustainment support for the Joint Reprogramming Enterprise (JRE). Supplies and services acquired under the anticipated contract will deliver sustainment support to the US Air Force (USAF), Navy (USN), Marine Corps (USMC), F-35 International Partners, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The maximum period of performance for this effort is five years, anticipated to begin in 2027 and end in 2032. Such work will include: 


	
	Recurring sustainment support for the Australia-Canada-United-Kingdom Reprogramming Lab (ACURL), Norway and Italy Reprogramming Lab (NIRL), and the United States Reprogramming Lab (USRL) located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The Principal Electronic-Warfare Reprogramming Lab (PERL) at Air Force Plant #4 in Fort Worth, Texas will also be supported under this contract vehicle in the future as it progresses to initial operational capability (IOC).  
	



	
	Support will consist of maintaining non-prime mission equipment, software tools, sub-systems, networks, support personnel, mission-planning equipment and software, and maintaining current configurations of hardware and software within the reprogramming labs for the duration of this contract. 
	


This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any capability statements, proposals, or quotations received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Lockheed Martin is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and integrator of the F-35 aircraft and related equipment. Lockheed Martin alone has the experience, special skills, proprietary technical documentation, software/algorithms, and technical expertise required to furnish the supplies and services within the required timeframe. Accordingly, Lockheed Martin is the only known qualified and responsible source able to fulfill the requirements specified herein. Subcontracting opportunities may be available and may be sought with Lockheed Martin through the primary point of contact (Sean Lightcap / 817-584-1276). 

This notice is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award (or awards), or be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties prior to award of a contract for the effort described above. Information provided herein is subject to change. The data associated with the F-35 JPO is export controlled and is not available to foreign sources or representatives.

The AN/ZLQ-V(2) HBS is the part of the MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) sensor system. It supports the Triton&rsquo;s persistent broad area intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission in maritime, littoral, and overland environments. The system consists of following WRAs: two (2) Short Baseline Interferometer (SBI) Antenna Assemblies (SAA), one (1) HPOI omnidirectional ADF array, one (1) SNC High-Band Chassis (HBC), and one (1) OMNI Radio Frequency Distribution (RFD) unit.

The proposed contract action is for the procurement of data for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Sierra Nevada Corporation, 1580 W Nursery Road A, Linthicum Heights, MD 21090, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (statutory authority 10 U.S.C 3204(a)(1)), only one responsible source. The requirement is being solicited on a sole source basis because Sierra Nevada Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and own the data package. In addition, data procurement from any other vendor would result in extensive duplication of costs to include re-engineering, re-certification, environmental qualifications to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements through any other source. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of re-evaluating the justification for sole source or limitation of sources and making a determination to change the acquisition strategy to a competitive procurement.

IAW 5.203(a)(1), the anticipated award date is on or before Jul 25, 2025. The applicable NAICS is 334419 with a size standard of 750 employees. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 United States Code (USC) 2302(b), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) and AFFARS 5313.501. The following is a brief description of the proposed contract action: The Vishay Measurement Group strain transducers are essential to capturing accurate strain data necessary for validating structural loads, flight envelope safety, and aerodynamic performance. Key performance attributes include: Precise strain sensitivity and calibration stability across varying temperatures and timeframes; Electrical compatibility with aircraft-specific data acquisition and signal conditioning systems; Physical adaptability to diverse mounting geometries tailored to individual test articles; And sustained reliability under conditions of high vibration, elevated temperatures, and dynamic structural loading. The required strain gages are produced exclusively by Vishay Measurement Group, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specified in the aircraft&rsquo;s design and airworthiness documentation. The aircraft in question are owned and controlled by the prime contractor, Northrop Grumman, and the 420th CTF does not have configuration control. This means only the original, OEM-specified parts may be used without invalidating the aircraft&rsquo;s flight worthiness certifications. Any deviation from the specified Vishay parts would trigger significant operational and financial consequences, including but not limited to: Redesign and recertification of aircraft electrical and mechanical subsystems by Northrop; Reworking sensor wiring and replacing interface components already installed; Procurement of alternative connectors, terminations, and integration hardware; Airworthiness re-approvals across multiple oversight channels; Delays in flight test schedules and program milestones, which could cost the Government tens of millions of dollars in cascading schedule impacts and lost readiness. Given these constraints, substitution is not acceptable, and no other manufacturer&rsquo;s parts will satisfy the Government&rsquo;s minimum needs. There are no solicitation documents; however, any vendors that believe they can meet the requirements described should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the requirement. In addition, the response should include verification of the Offeror Representation and Certifications--Commercial Items in accordance to FAR 52.212-3. If the offer does not have a copy of this provision, go to http://www.sam.gov/ to load the required information. Any response received without completing this registration will be considered noncompliant. Further, the response should include any special requirements for a commercial contract (i.e. Commercial Financing, Warranty Provisions, Delivery Information, etc.) in accordance with FAR part 12. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government representative to evaluate and determine if it can meet the requirement. Responses must be received no later than (NLT) 1130, Pacific Date Time, 25 July 2025. Responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, 1st Lt Austen Siegler at austen.siegler.1@us.af.mil.

SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT - Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), intends to solicit and negotiate a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) with the possibility of Firm-Fixed-Pricing (FFP) Job Order (JO) 0001 made under the five year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N0016425GJQ32 to Meggitt Defense Systems, 9801 Muirlands Boulevard, Irvine, CA 92618 (CAGE 62228), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). The proposed contract action will be for the purchase of Liquid Air Palletized Systems (LAPS), Air Handling Units (AHUs), PIO Spare Parts, Engineering Support, Repair parts and associated data.

The proposed contract action is a job order for which the Government intends to be award in quarter one of fiscal year 2026 under FAR Part 16. The contemplated contract action will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements. Meggitt Defense Systems is the only company with the requisite expertise, knowledge, experience, and facilities necessary to meet these requirements without unacceptable delays. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of a technical data package necessary to support competition. Any other source would result in duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s requirements.

Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Meggitt Defense Systems directly. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal that shall be considered by the agency.  However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of re-evaluating the justification for sole source or limitation of sources and making a determination to change the acquisition strategy to a competitive procurement. All responsible sources&rsquo; submissions shall include rationale to overcome the basis of the restriction of competition. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. This is not a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation, and this information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.   

A Letter RFP will be sent directly to Meggitt Defense Systems. A RFP will not be posted on SAM.gov.

2bd028c3fdf24e54913a32d4ba4fd9c3,MDA25MRBMLot3,Medium Range Ballistic Missile Type 1/Type 2 Direct Productive Labor Hours for Engineering Services and Lot 3 Mission Planning Options Combined Sources Sought/Notice of Intent to Sole Source,"Purpose:

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Targets Program seeks information and capable sources for market research to support the paradigm shift to rapidly perform services related to the Medium Range Ballistic Missile Type 1/Type 2 (MRBM T1/T2) eSR-19 Flight Test Support and Direct Productive Labor Hours for Engineering Services. The Government also encourages use of commercial components, subsystems or systems, as well as responses from non-traditional contractors in accordance with the recent Executive Orders. The information contained herein only initiates communication with industry to assess market potential. No solicitation document exists currently. This Request for Information (RFI) constitutes no Government obligation to procure these items or issue a solicitation. The Government does not have an obligation to pay for information responding to this RFI. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), the Government will allow for capacity statements for follow-on contracts.

MDA is seeking alternate sources that can provide Direct Productive Labor Hours for MRBM T1/T2 Engineering Services to support the Missile Defense System test program. If no alternate sources are identified for the Direct Productive Labor Hours, the Government intends to issue a sole source contract to Aerojet Rocketdyne Coleman Aerospace (ARCA), CAGE 7VXX4, 7675 Municipal Dr., Orlando, FL 32819-8930 under Statutory Authority 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1) as implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Based on currently available information, MDA believes that only ARCA can provide the required services without substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays, since ARCA owns the MRBM T1/T2 Technical Data Package. Under a new sole-source contract, the MRBM T1/T2 Direct Productive Labor Hours period of performance will be January 1, 2030 to December 31, 2035.  This notice is intended to meet the requirements of both FAR Part 5 and DFARS PGI 206.302-1.

MDA is seeking alternate sources that can provide eSR-19 Flight Test support (Pre-Mission Analysis, Air Launch Target Preparation, Air Launch Target Execution, and Post-Mission Analysis) for eight (8) air-launched Lot 3 MRBM T1/T2 targets, to include Systems Engineering Program Management, Program Management Office Support, Integrated Logistics Support, launch vehicle storage, and eSR-19 motor transportation.  If no alternate sources are identified for the Lot 3 mission planning, the Government intends to issue a sole-source contract to ARCA. Based on currently available information, MDA believes that only ARCA can provide the required services without substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays, since ARCA owns the Technical Data Package. The period of performance for eSR-19 Flight Test Support is anticipated to be executed from September 2028 to potentially as far as December 2035. This notice is intended to meet the requirements of both FAR Part 5 and DFARS PGI 206.302-1.

Description of the Requirement:

Engineering Services are defined as requirements analysis, testing, and verification, or as integration assessments, special studies, and support activities to determine the impact of changes in threats, missions, and tests that require quick reaction analysis and action. Engineering Services are performed on Task Instructions (TI) with the understanding that implementation is within the present scope/Statement of Work and that it does not change the statement of work or other terms and conditions.  TIs are used for quick-turn, pre-priced solutions to execute systems engineering activities including quick-look analysis of potential payload modifications, analysis of alternative test scenarios, studies and analysis, software maintenance and support, engineering test support, resolution of unanticipated design or implementation issues associated with support equipment, integration, concept of operations and interfaces.

Lot 3 is the final lot purchase of MRBM T1/T2 targets and consists of tails 13-18.  Each of the following mission planning options will be required for each Lot 3 target: 


	Pre-mission analysis: Develop mission execution specific test requirements including signature/trajectory and software requirements and conduct Mission System Requirements Reviews and Mission Design Reviews.
	Post-mission analysis: Perform post-flight data reduction and post-flight kinematic updates and signature performance assessments.
	Air-launch target preparation: Perform final target integration, missionization, and Kit C integration (if selected as an option) for Type 2 targets; integrate the target systems at the target integration site for air-launches and perform final assembly, integration and test of the Carriage Extraction System in support of mission operations.
	Air-launch target execution: Support missile launch dress rehearsals at forward staging area and conduct target launch operations to include support for Flight Termination System End to End checks and flight readiness review at the forward staging area.


Additionally, Systems Engineering Program Management, Program Management Office Support, and Integrated Logistics Support are required.

Responses:

1) Responses should address the ability to perform engineering services and/or perform mission planning for air-launched MRBM T1/T2 targets while complying with MDA&rsquo;s Systems Engineering Processes.  

2) Responses should also address the associated detailed schedule that supports reviews, design, development, testing, production, MBRV delivery date, launch vehicle integration, and flight test execution at the required Best Estimated Test Date. 

3) Responses should also address the cost estimate associated for the effort.

Submission Instructions:


	There is a 25-page limit for this RFI, which should contain an executive summary, capabilities/plans/activities, and figures/tables/graphs.

The contemplated LTC will have a five (5) year base period and one (1) five-year option period, for a potential total contract period of ten (10) years. This vehicle will facilitate the issuance of future delivery orders and/or task orders for the identified items (see attachment).

Sole Source Justification: The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, The Boeing Company (Cage 0PXV4) under the authority of 10 U.S.C.
3204 (a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

Intellectual Property (IP) and Exclusivity: The Boeing Company (Cage 0PXV4) maintains exclusive ownership of the intellectual property (IP) required to manufacture and repair these components. This includes, but is not limited to, proprietary software, engineering and manufacturing processes, Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE), and specialized tooling. This exclusive ownership significantly restricts competition to only those sources that have been formally approved by the Navy Design Agent Authority.

Criticality, Navy Design Agent Approval, and Quality Requirements: Due to the criticality designation of the identified items (National Stock Numbers (NSNs) identified have been designated as critical safety items), all interested sources must be formally approved by the Navy Design Agent Authority to be eligible for award under these vehicles.
This strict requirement is essential to ensure the continued airworthiness, safety, and operational readiness of Navy aircraft. Furthermore, interested sources will be required to comply with Higher-Level Contract Quality Requirements in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.246-11, Higher-Level Contract Quality Requirement.

While interested sources are invited to submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package, it is imperative to note that due to the Fleet’s urgent need for the subject repair or spare efforts, the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that the contemplated award cannot be delayed pending the approval of a new source. Submission of a SAR, however, may enable an interested firm to become an approved source for future procurements.

If you are not currently an approved source, you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP-WSS Source Approval Information Brochure.
Additional information for submitting a Source Approval Request package can be obtained at: https://www.navsup.navy.mil/NAVSUP-Enterprise/NAVSUP-Weapon-Systems-Support/Business-Opps/ 

Government Discretion and No Delay: A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Source Approval is required for eligibility. NAVSUP WSS will not delay award while Source Approval is pending.

468789c36903468189930dad8c414e63,FA852425Q0007,Repair of the Vertical Indicators on the TH-1H Helicopter,"This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation; a quote is being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.

FA8524-25-Q-0007 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This is not a small business set-aside. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular. Please see the attachment titled CLAUSES.

This quote is for Repair Services for 4-each Vertical Indicators (NSN: 6610-01-552-8582; P/N: 30230-81110) over a 1-year period of performance (POP) in support of the TH-1H helicopter program. The Vertical Indicator is a commercial item. This aircraft is a training platform stationed at Fort Rucker, Alabama. The fleet size is 28.

CLIN Structure: 0001 (Repair)

NSN: 6610-01-552-8582        Noun: Vertical Indicators       Qty: 4 EACH

CLIN Structure: 0002 -No Fault Found (NFF)/ Beyond Economical Repair (BER)

NSN: 6610-01-552-8582        Noun: Vertical Indicators

Pricing is requested for the Unit Price of each Unit (Vertical Indicator) for Repair, and pricing for the Unit Price for an asset that is deemed No Fault Found (NFF)/ Beyond Economical Repair (BER). Please also provide the overall price to accomplish the requested repairs.

The POP shall consist of a basic one-year period after the contract award. The contract type is a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order. Repairs shall be completed within 60 days after induction per the Performance Work Statement issued on 11 June 2025.

Given this acquisition meets the definition of a commercial item and there is pricing history available, use of a Firm Fixed Price contract type was deemed the most appropriate contract type for execution of this acquisition. This contract type should result in best value/lowest risk to the Government. Because the total value of this procurement is below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), FAR Part 13, which governs Simplified Acquisition Procedures, is applicable. The Government does not own any data or data rights.

Inspection and Acceptance will be at F.O.B. Origin: Robins AFB, GA 31098-1887

The current need for operational components does not allow for unqualified sources to take the time necessary to reverse engineer each component to conduct a repair therefore, sole source repair from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is recommended. Authority: 10 U.S.C.2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Due to lack of technical data, this effort will be sole source to Aerosonic, LLC; 1212 N Hercules Ave; Clearwater, Florida 33765-1920. CAGE: 98810 is the OEM therefore this requirement will be sole source to: Aerosonic, LLC. (Cage: 98810).

Quotes are due on 4 Aug 2025 at 3:00 PM, EST. No telephone or fax requests will be honored. NO HARD COPIES WILL BE ISSUED.

Development of Benchmark Building Designs
to Assess National Functional Recovery Design Provisions

Announcement Type: Special Notice

Announcement Number: NIST-NOI-25-7302141

Subject: Development of Benchmark Building Designs to Assess National Functional Recovery Design Provisions
 

Introduction
This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.

Purpose
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed priced purchase order on a sole source basis with the National Institute of Building Science (NIBS), UEI: HYNHS5VQEFC3, located at 2121 K Street NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20037-1811. The purchase order will be for development of benchmark building designs to assess national functional recovery design provisions. The order will have an eighteen-month period of performance.

Authority
This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106(b)(1) allowing the Contracting Officer (CO) to solicit from one source. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541330 &ndash; Engineering Services with a size standard of $25.5 Million.

Description
NIST requires Contractor support to develop realistic benchmark building design test cases and document and compile the relevant design and response data. The Contractor shall develop benchmark building designs that are representative of typical U.S. design and construction practice with specific details on both structural and nonstructural design specifications. Each design shall be re-designed and assessed according to the new functional recovery design provisions currently being considered for adoption in ASCE 7. A report shall be developed by the Contractor documenting the details of each building design and any issues identified when considering Functional Recovery performance targets. Please see the attached proposed Statement of Work for details.

Sole Source Determination
The sole source determination is based on the following:

The design test cases to be developed shall be based on new functional recovery building design provisions developed by the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) which are currently being considered for adoption under ASCE 7.

As NIBS is the developer and facilitator of the provisions under consideration, and has organized the panel of experts that is preparing the proposed provisions, no other contractor has the knowledge or capability to prepare design test cases based on the draft provisions. NIBS is the only contractor capable of performing the required services.

Information for Interested Parties
Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing by or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation.

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Ms. Lauren Roller, Contract Specialist, at Lauren.Roller@nist.gov.

This synopsis is being posted to http://www.sam.gov/. Sam.gov is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet. Please feel free to use the Sam.gov site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.

SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT &ndash; Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane&rsquo;s intends to solicit and negotiate a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Job Order 0003 made under the five year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N0016422GJQ65 to Raytheon Company (Cage Code - 96214) on a sole source basis for engineering services, including low value material and repair of repairables that support life cycle sustainment of the Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) used on various Navy, Army, Air Force and Special Operational Forces platforms.

The proposed contract action is a follow on job order for services for which the Government intends to be awarded in quarter four of fiscal year 2025 under FAR Part 16. The contemplated contract action will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements. Raytheon Company, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), is the only company with the requisite expertise, knowledge, experience, and facilities necessary to meet these requirements without unacceptable delays. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of technical data package to support competition of repair and sustainment of the MTS. Any other source would result in duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s requirements.

Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Company directly. All responsible sources may submit capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of re-evaluating the justification for sole source or limitation of sources and making a determination to change the acquisition strategy. All responsible sources submissions shall include rational to overcome the basis of the restriction of competition. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse respondents or any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. This is not a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation, and this information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.  

A Letter RFP will be sent directly to Raytheon Company.  A RFP will not be posted on SAM.gov.

Contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the controlled attachments. Offerors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the internet at https://www.sam.gov. Information about the JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil. The controlled attachments will be posted to SAM at the same time the RFP is posted. SAM may be accessed at http://www.SAM.gov.

For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and / or award.

See attached Statement of Need
STATEMENT OF NEED
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)
NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) OFFICE OF OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH (OAR) CHEMICAL SCIENCES LABORATORY (CSL)
PURPOSE:
The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory Tropospheric Chemistry Group (CSL7) requires the purchase of specially manufactured components to build 12 aircraft-certified racks that will be used for housing instrumentation. The aircraft-certified instrument racks are mission-critical equipment for the upcoming AiRMAPS (Airborne and Remote sensing Multi Air Pollutant Surveys) field campaign. NOAA CSL7 has already worked with the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, to create a rack design that is pre-approved for NOAA aircraft (such as the P-3) . All parts must meet exact technical specifications, specific machining standards, must be composed of specific aluminum alloys, and must be able to withstand 5G forces. NOAA CSL7 now needs to purchase enough parts for 12 aircraft instrument racks,
which will then be subsequently assembled at the lab, and then deployed on NOAA aircraft during the AiRMAPS field campaign which is projected to continue into 2028. Inability to purchase these materials would compromise both immediate and far-reaching mission objectives to survey air pollutants across the United States. The aircraft rack components will be delivered within 4 weeks after purchase.
SCOPE OR MISSION:
The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory performs state-of-the-art air quality measurements to support forecasting models, inform air quality manager decision making, and conduct cutting-edge research. This could not be accomplished without the custom instrumentation designed, built, and deployed by NOAA CSL7 on aircraft during large-scale field campaigns (such as AiRMAPS) to survey and do chemical measurements on the atmosphere across urban and rural areas of the United States.
BACKGROUND:
The current inventory of aircraft racks used for NOAA CSL7 missions no longer meet certifications to fly on NOAA aircraft, as well as on other platforms operated by research partners, such as NASA and NSF. Scientific instruments deployed during field missions must be securely housed in aircraft-certified racks that can withstand the significant forces and maneuvering that occur during flight. NOAA CSL7 has worked with both the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL to design a new instrument rack prototype that has been demonstrated to meet aircraft rack certification standards and fulfill mission requirements. A quantity of 12 such aircraft racks are needed for housing scientific instrumentation in order to conduct in-flight measurements and surveys during the upcoming AiRMAPS field campaign. Therefore, this purchase order request will provide the numerous specialized components required for assembling the 12 aircraft racks ahead of deploying them during upcoming field missions.
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
1. Rack components have been designed by Pagnotta Engineering and have been approved by NOAA Aircraft Operations (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, for flight on the NOAA P-3 aircraft. All parts must meet exact technical specifications to ISO 9001:2015 machining standards.
2. All parts must be composed of aluminum alloys 6061 or 7075.

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), on behalf of Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS 6.0), intends to utilize other than full and open competition to award an AN/WSN-12 Navigation Processor Module (NPM) Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC). The AN/WSN-12 NPM LRIP contract will be a follow-on contract to the existing AN/WSN-7/7A Ring Laser Gyro Navigators (RLGN) and AN/WSN-7B Ring Laser Gyrocompasses (RLG) production contract (N00024-20-D-5230). The N00024-20-D-5230 contract was awarded to NGSC for WSN-7 Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) production.

The AN/WSN-12 Inertial Navigation System (INS) has two main components, the Inertial Sensor Module (ISM) and the Navigation Processor Module (NPM). The AN/WSN-12 ISM production contract (N00024-23-C-5234) was awarded to NGSC for the ISM component full rate production in December of 2022. The planned AN/WSN-12 NPM LRIP contract will provide the necessary engineering support, production, and testing of the AN/WSN-12 NPM and includes integration with the ISM (from N00024-23-C-5234) resulting in the complete INS. Additionally, this effort will include retrofitting one AN/WSN-7X Engineering Development Model (EDM) shipset, developed under contract N00024-20-D-5230, into the AN/WSN-12 INS configuration. This contract will address the Navy&rsquo;s INS requirements by satisfying new construction ship deliveries from FY 2028 through FY 2030.
