Source Approval Requests

 If there is an open solicitation for a national stock number for which you want to submit a SAR, please submit it directly to the buyer noted on the solicitation. (NOTE: This applies to open solicitations only). SAR&rsquo;s will not be evaluated for items that are already designated as fully competitive such as those items coded AMSC &ldquo;G&rdquo; and described by drawings and specifications. If you are submitting a SAR for a NSN with no open solicitation we are no longer accepting CDs by mail. SARs must be submitted using the DoD SAFE file transmission site, https://safe.apps.mil/. The new process streamlines processing with electronic transmission and eliminates the need for multiple mailings of CDs. New Process: To submit your SAR please send an email to: dlaavnsmallbus@dla.mil, subject &quot;request a SAR drop off&quot;. After we receive your email request a &quot;request for drop off&quot; will be returned, where you can download your file. Include CAGE code, the NSN and the email address where you want to receive the link. For guidance on completing the SAR package please review the Source Approval Handbook. SARs may not be processed if it is determined that the SAR is not cost effective due to low item demand. Please review the DLA Supplier Requirements Visibility Application: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/ ra/srva/default.aspx for estimated forecasting requirements before submitting a SAR.

Electronic transmission eliminates the need for CDs for each of the services that manage the item (i.e. if the item is managed by the Navy and Air Force.) If you would like to see how many services, use the NSN you can download PUB LOG FLIS to see how many services use the item and who approved sources are. You can download the PUB LOG FLIS using the instructions at: FLISSearchDownloadInstructions.pdf The PUB LOG FLIS executable file connects to a secure server that stores and returns data with each query. This data is updated weekly. Once in the database, put in the NSN, hit Search. Under the &ldquo;Management&rdquo; tab, you will see the MOE code for the number of ESAs involved. The review process can take over 180 days from the date the SAR is received by DLA Aviation. Once a decision is made, you will receive a formal notification letter advising you of the results.

        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.
        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.
3.7   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material
will be cause for rejection.
       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The
contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting
Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.
       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of
contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are
located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.
       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a
polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the
requirements of this contract are concerned.
       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.
       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:
       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a
component could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface
ship atmosphere.
4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE
4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,

If your company has manufacturing capabilities, please submit a Source Approval Package (SAR) for technical review and evaluation since this item is sole source to the following sources:

OEM SIKORSKYAIRCRAFT CORP (78286) P/N 71207-82230-041

&quot;Item cited requires data which is restricted to contractors certified by DoD to access unclassified data per DoD 5220.22M.  Certification is obtained by submitting DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, to the Defense Logistics Information Services.&quot;

Source Approval Requests

If there is an open solicitation for a national stock number for which you want to submit a SAR, please
submit it directly to the buyer noted on the solicitation. (NOTE: This applies to open solicitations only).
SAR&rsquo;s will not be evaluated for items that are already designated as fully competitive such as those items coded AMSC &ldquo;G&rdquo; and described by drawings and specifications.

If you are submitting a SAR for a NSN with no open solicitation we are no longer accepting CDs by mail.  SARs must be submitted using the DoD SAFE file transmission site, https://safe.apps.mil/. The new process streamlines processing with electronic transmission and eliminates the need for multiple
mailings of CDs.

New Process: To submit your SAR please send an email to: dlaavnsmallbus@dla.mil, subject &quot;request a
SAR drop off&quot;. After we receive your email request a &quot;request for drop off&quot; will be returned, where you
can download your file. Include CAGE code, the NSN and the email address where you want to receive
the link.

For guidance on completing a SAR package please review the Source Approval Handbook.
SARs may not be processed if it is determined that the SAR is not cost effective due to low item demand.

Please review the DLA Supplier Requirements Visibility Application: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/
ra/srva/default.aspx for estimated forecasting requirements before submitting a SAR.

Electronic transmission eliminates the need for CDs for each of the services that manage the item (i.e. if
the item is managed by the Navy and Air Force.) If you would like to see how many services use the NSN you can download PUB LOG FLIS to see how many services use the item and who approved sources are.

You can download the PUB LOG FLIS using the instructions at: FLISSearchDownloadInstructions.pdf
The PUB LOG FLIS executable file connects to a secured server that stores and returns data with each
query. This data is updated weekly. Once in the database, put in the NSN, hit Search. Under the
&ldquo;Management&rdquo; tab, you will see the MOE code for the number of ESAs involved.
The review process can take over 180 days from the date the SAR is received by DLA Aviation. Once a
decision is made, you will receive a formal notification letter advising you of the results.
If you have any questions, please email the DLA Aviation SAR analyst at dlaavnsmallbus@dla.mil.

If your company has manufacturing capabilities, please submit a Source Approval Package (SAR) for technical review and evaluation since this item is sole source to the following sources:

MEGGITT (NORTH HOLLYWOOD), INC (79318) P/N 324691



&quot;Item cited requires data which is restricted to contractors certified by DoD to access unclassified data per DoD 5220.22M.  Certification is obtained by submitting DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, to the Defense Logistics Information Services.&quot;



Source Approval Requests



If there is an open solicitation for a national stock number for which you want to submit a SAR, please

submit it directly to the buyer noted on the solicitation. (NOTE: This applies to open solicitations only).

SAR&rsquo;s will not be evaluated for items that are already designated as fully competitive such as those items coded AMSC &ldquo;G&rdquo; and described by drawings and specifications.



If you are submitting a SAR for a NSN with no open solicitation we are no longer accepting CDs by mail.  SARs must be submitted using the DoD SAFE file transmission site, https://safe.apps.mil/. The new process streamlines processing with electronic transmission and eliminates the need for multiple

mailings of CDs.



New Process: To submit your SAR please send an email to: dlaavnsmallbus@dla.mil, subject &quot;request a

SAR drop off&quot;. After we receive your email request a &quot;request for drop off&quot; will be returned, where you

can download your file. Include CAGE code, the NSN and the email address where you want to receive

the link.



For guidance on completing a SAR package please review the Source Approval Handbook.

SARs may not be processed if it is determined that the SAR is not cost effective due to low item demand.



Please review the DLA Supplier Requirements Visibility Application: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/

ra/srva/default.aspx for estimated forecasting requirements before submitting a SAR.



Electronic transmission eliminates the need for CDs for each of the services that manage the item (i.e. if

the item is managed by the Navy and Air Force.) If you would like to see how many services use the NSN you can download PUB LOG FLIS to see how many services use the item and who approved sources are.



You can download the PUB LOG FLIS using the instructions at: FLISSearchDownloadInstructions.pdf

The PUB LOG FLIS executable file connects to a secured server that stores and returns data with each

query. This data is updated weekly. Once in the database, put in the NSN, hit Search. Under the

&ldquo;Management&rdquo; tab, you will see the MOE code for the number of ESAs involved.

The review process can take over 180 days from the date the SAR is received by DLA Aviation. Once a

decision is made, you will receive a formal notification letter advising you of the results.

If you have any questions, please email the DLA Aviation SAR analyst at dlaavnsmallbus@dla.mil.

3.4   SHELF LIFE REQUIREMENT - The following is excerpts from DOD 4140.27-M Shelf Life Management Manual.  This requirement is mandated by MIL-STD-129P referenced under the Preservation, Packing and Marking portion of this TDP.
2-12.  85 Percent SHELF-LIFE REMAINING REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO ACQUISITION/PROCUREMENT
       A.  Acquisition/procurement documentation shall specify that shelf-life items/material will have not less than 85 percent (allowing for rounding to whole months) of shelf-life remaining at time of receipt by the first Government activity.  Any delivery
from a contractor not having at least 85 percent shelf-life remaining shall normally be considered non-conforming.  Refer to Appendix E of this Manual to determine the amount of time that 85% equates to in terms of remaining shelf life for Type I or Type II
shelf-life codes.
       B.  In supporting imminent use or consumption, the 85% shelf-life remaining on receipt by first Government activity may be modified or adjusted as deemed prudent at the discretion of PMs and IMMs, when support alternative arrangements such as EC, PV, DVD
or local purchase are effected.  Use of support alternatives for shipment/delivery to storage facilities as stock will conform to the 85% rule.
2-13.  CONTRACTOR MARKING.  Shelf life items will be marked for identification and control.  Markings, shown below the item identification data are required on all units, intermediate, and exterior packs or unpacked items, shall be per MIL STD 129, MIL-STD-130,
MIL STD 290 (FSC 9150 only), or FED STD 123, (references (m) through (p)) respectively, and will include the following:
       A.  For Type I shelf life items:  apply one, as appropriate; date manufactured, date cured (for elastomeric and rubber products only), date assembled, or date packed (subsistence only); and expiration date.
        B.  For Type II shelf life items: apply one, as appropriate; date manufactured, date cured (for elastomeric and other rubber products only), date assembled, and date packed (subsistence only), and inspect/test date.
        C.  For both Type I and Type II markings in subparagraphs A and B above: the date shall be expressed by the numeric month and the last 2 digits of the calendar year; i.e., 06/95, with the day of that month being the last day.
       D.  Different Dates on Identical Items.  When two or more unit
packs of identical items bear different dates of manufacture, dates of cure, dates of pack, or dates of assembly, the earliest date shall be shown on the shipping container.
        E.  For Type I drugs and biologicals: the expiration date only is required.  The expiration date should be marked in accordance with FED-SPEC PPP C 186 (reference (q)).  Manufacturer date shall not be shown for medical items having expiration dates.
       F.  For cure-dated items: shelf life markings on physical material are expressed by month or quarter and year designations (i.e., 11/2001,or 3Q2001).  Shelf life periods end on the last day of the cited month or quarter.

Source Approval Requests

If there is an open solicitation for a national stock number for which you want to submit a SAR, please submit it directly to the buyer noted on the solicitation. SAR&rsquo;s will not be evaluated for items that are already designated as fully competitive such as those items coded AMSC &quot;G&quot; and described by drawings and specifications. (NOTE: This applies to open solicitations only).

If you are submitting a SAR for a NSN with no open solicitation, please send it to: DLA Aviation, Attn: DLA AVN-DU (SAR Program Manager), 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway, Richmond, VA 23297-5100

For help in completing the request, access the Source Approval Handbook. Please submit your nonreturnable SARs on CDs.

SARs may not be processed if it is determined that the SAR is not cost effective due to low item demand. Please review the DLA Supplier Requirements Visibility Application (hotlink) https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/ra/srva/default.aspx for estimated forecasting requirements before submitting a SAR.

You need to provide SARs for each of the services that manage the item (i.e. two copies of the SAR is needed if the item is managed by the Navy and Air Force.) You will need to download PUB LOG FLIS to see how many services use the item and who approved sources are. You can download the PUB LOG FLIS using the instructions HERE.

The executable file connects to a secured server that stores and returns data with each query. This data is updated weekly. Once in the database, put in the NSN, hit Search. Under the &quot;Management&quot; tab, you will see the MOE code for the number of SARs needed. Failure to provide the correct number of copies will delay your SAR review.

The review process can take over 180 days from the date the SAR is received by DLA Aviation. Once a decision is made, you will receive a formal notification letter advising you of the results.

If you have any questions, please call the DLA Aviation SAR analyst at 804-279-5114
