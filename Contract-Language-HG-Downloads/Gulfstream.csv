THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   



Brand Name: Tronair is the most recognized jack for the Gulfstream aircraft and is recommended by Gulfstream in the technical manuals. The one feature of the 30 ton jack we are requesting is the capability to use an air manifold kit that other jacks cannot provide. The manifold kit allows the mechanics to use shop air to raise both wing jacks simultaneously to keep the aircraft level versus individual jacks being hand pumped by personnel. Manifolding the jacks saves time and resources when raising the aircraft. Since the Tronair jack is the most common jack, servicing, maintenance, and parts are readily available and any GSE service company can work on them.

	Description


Scope:  The purpose of this acquisition is to renew 10 MFB (Military Flight Bag) Electronic Performance Licenses Subscriptions that enable comprehensive flight planning, in-flight support, heavy tail dispatch, weather briefing, Active NAVLOG oceanic chart plotting /gross navigational error detection and performance runway analysis for the unit&rsquo;s C-37A and C-37B aircraft.   Active NAVLOG oceanic chart plotting/gross navigational error detection, and performance runway analysis services in accordance with Gulfstream AFM data. The scope incorporates aircraft flight services, to include Electronic Performance License Subscriptions that are required for Air Station Washington to safely carry out the worldwide Long-Range Command and Control mission for the Department of Homeland Security, Commandant, and other senior government officials.



This contract will fall under NAICS code 334511. Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be attached in synopsis.



3. Statutory Authority.

FAR 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.



FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i): Soliciting from a single source.



(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.



(i) Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization).





4. Reasons for Authority Cited:

ForeFlight specializes in aircraft flight planning services. These services are essential to conducting safe, reliable, and efficient on -demand transport for Air Station Washington&rsquo;s unique mission requirements. ForeFlight allows pilots to easily plan short and long distance routes incorporating altitude and airspace restrictions using real-time and historical data to ensure efficient and safe sorties for pilots and the flight planning department. Additionally Foreflight has a seamless integration with Jeppesen Military Dispatch Service, the current provider for international flight planning dispatch for Air Station Washington&rsquo;s VIP Transport mission. Jeppesen Military Dispatch can push complicated flight plans and essential foreign country clearance data directly to the pilot&rsquo;s Foreflight Application. This capability is imperative for pilot situational awareness when flying in unfamiliar and potentially hostile foreign air-space. This application offers detailed weather forecasts including METAR, TAF, MOS and radar map overlay tools that Coast Guard pilots are exclusively trained with for navigating and planning intricate logistics and search and rescue missions. This software has demonstrated extremely accurate fuel planning estimates for the C-37A and C-37B aircraft profiles, which is essential for missions which can be more than 4,000NM. Pilots conduct FAA certified GV type simulator training using Foreflight Runway Analysis procedures in preparation for take-offs and landings at airports with hazardous terrain and high altitudes in accordance with training syllabus outlined in a separate CG contract with vendor &ldquo;Flight Safety International or &ldquo;FSI&rdquo;. Since Coast Guard Air Station Operational Commanders exclusively use the Foreflight software, maintaining  compatibility is imperative when tasked for hurricane and flood overflight requests as tactical commanders can electronically push overflight routes to Air Station Washington Air Crews.  Foreflight&rsquo;s combination of real-time data, seamless user experience when interfacing with other CG Units who use ForeFlight for their day-to-day operations, extensive charting capabilities, mobile-friendly design, Active NAVLOG oceanic chart plotting/gross navigational error detection and the training syllabus under a separate contract make it the Coast Guard and Air Station Washington&rsquo;s solution for flight planning.

In an effort to keep NOAA’s WP-3D aircraft airworthy in accordance with the approved maintenance plan the aircraft Fire Extinguisher System requires periodic maintenance.  Specifically, the High Rate Discharge (HRD) Bottle requires overhaul and hydro testing every five years.  This requirement cannot be waived.  Currently, all four of aircraft N42RF’s engine HRD bottles are due for overhaul or replacement.  Since the cost of overhaul is much cheaper ($7.2K ea.) than replacing the bottles ($35K ea.) it is desirable to have them overhauled. The overhaul must include hydro static testing, refilling the bottle and certifying the work performed.  All work must be performed in accordance with applicable maintenance manuals.  If the HRD bottle is overhauled the contractor shall replace all parts necessary to accomplish the overhaul with factory new OEM parts or FAA-PMA equivalent components and return the HRD bottle to service. The contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables.The work performed shall be documented on an FAA 8130-3, Certificate of Conformance or equivalent.

35616ed23709408ab41f2c80d6c584e2,20210PR230000036,"Notice of Intent to Sole Source - HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL, INC.","THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS

1. Contracting Agency and Activity: The United States Coast Guard, Air Station Washington DC, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract to HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL, INC. The anticipated period of performance is September 29th, 2023, to September 28th, 2024.



2. Description

Scope:  The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire datalink communications and graphical weather services that are compatible with the Primus Epic/Elite avionics and flight management systems installed onboard the USCG&rsquo;s Gulfstream C-37A and C-37B aircraft. The scope incorporates aircraft flight services, to include flight deck communication, information access, weather services, and flight tracking compatible with the Primus Epic/Elite equipment installed onboard the USCG&rsquo;s Gulfstream C-37A and C-37B aircrafts. The Datalink Services and Graphical Weather Services are required for Air Station Washington to safely carry out the worldwide Long-Range Command and Control mission for the Department of Homeland Security, Commandant, and other senior government officials.



This contract will fall under NAICS code 336413. Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be attached.



3. Statutory Authority.

FAR 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.



FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i): Soliciting from a single source.



(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.



(i) Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization).





4. Reasons for Authority Cited:

Honeywell specializes in aircraft flight services, to include flight deck communication, information access, weather services, and flight tracking. These services are essential to conducting safe, reliable, and efficient on -demand transport for Air Station Washington&rsquo;s unique mission requirements. Honeywell provides data that is a collaborated effort between Jeppesen (Aviation Charts) and Honeywell (avionics to display electronic charts). These aircraft flight services are necessary to utilize with the Primus Elite avionics equipment and the Honeywell flight Management Systems (FMS) installed onboard the C-37A and C-37B aircraft. Honeywell operates in tandem with their propriety hardware in order to provide the best navigation / datalink communication package. Other software is not compatible with the Honeywell equipment installed in the aircraft. Honeywell&rsquo;s hardware is installed standard on Gulfstream aircraft and is the only service to offer a comprehensive package that includes datalink services across the VHF networks, as well as engine trend monitoring. The software is compatible and designed to function with the Honeywell Primus Epic Elite system installed on both aircraft. Other services offered are either not compatible, or do not offer all required services. The installation of Honeywell equipment on board is part of the aircraft certification process; alternate hardware installation is not an option. In order to overcome this barrier it would be necessary to remove the Epic Planeview system which is an integral part of the cockpit &amp; installed standard on all Gulfstream G-V/550 aircraft. This would be an invasive removal that would complicate compatibility with other aircraft equipment. There are a limited number of datalink providers and Honeywell is the only provider that offers all required services compatible with the equipment installed onboard the C-37A and C-37B aircraft.





THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS

Comment on the process by which you may adapt these existing designs to meet the requirements in the Draft Statement of Work (SOW).  Also, provide details and comments on how the relocation of existing aircraft antennas or systems were completed for these existing designs on Gulfstream aircraft. 

2)   In addition to standard structural, aerodynamic, and stability analyses that would normally be completed for the installation of large items protruding from the aircraft&rsquo;s outer mold line, are there other analyses that you would complete to verify airworthiness of the aircraft.

3)   A conceptual layout sketch layout and installation of the SAR antennas is included in the Draft SOW.  Potential offerors will be encouraged to provide improvements or alternatives to the layout and installation.  Provide your initial thoughts on the feasibility likelihood to either adopt the concept or propose an alternative.

4)   Depot maintenance inspection is required within the planned schedule for the aircraft modification.  To minimize overall schedule, NASA is considering the option of performing depot maintenance in conjunction with the aircraft modification.  If NASA were to include this option, how likely are you to provide a contract proposal?  Provide some examples of when you have successfully accomplished similar concurrent tasking in the past.

5)   Provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) and your assessment of the proposed period of performance.

a)   Feasibility of completing modification design, fabrication, and installation within proposed period of performance.

b)   Feasibility of completing modification and depot maintenance within proposed period of performance

6)   If arranged, would your company be interested in a site survey to visit the aircraft at Langley Research Center?  Visit scheduling would be based on aircraft availability.  No government funding provided.

Please provide the following company specific information:

1)   Name and address of firm and Point of Contact information.

2)   Size of business

3)   Average annual revenue for past three years.

Each aircraft undergoes periodic scheduled and unscheduled maintenance that requires specific tools, parts, and test equipment. As a result, an efficient, safe, and non-damaging mode of transportation for heavy aircraft equipment is critical for maintenance operations.



(II)       This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NM-AN2200-23-01255, NAME: AOC Tire Cart



(III)      The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2023-02.



(IV)      This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,250 Employees. 



(V)       This specification contains requirements for



A dedicated aviation tire service cart, capable of bearing heavy aircraft equipment, is required to transport tire and wheel assemblies, servicing equipment, and maintenance tools from the aviation warehouse to the hangar. Agency needs include: a cart narrow enough to navigate confined spaces, a high load bearing capacity, and large enough to haul all required equipment in a single trip. A towable service cart will decrease maintenance turnaround times by providing a rapid and functional method of transportation for historically person-carried items. While multiple pieces of equipment can be hauled at a time, maintenance personnel can shift focus to actions on the aircraft instead of relocation of parts.

Throughout hurricane season, the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) advertises mission response actions within a 24 hour period, better known as alert 24. Efficient maintenance practices help to ensure that NOAA aircraft are returned to service with minimal down time. While NOAA&rsquo;s heavy aircraft will derive the greatest benefit, all T/M/S aircraft at AOC will be positively affected by the purchase of a tire service cart. As hurricane season 2023 rapidly approaches, it is recommended to prioritize this purchase for immediate use.

Requirements 

An efficient mode of transportation for aircraft tires, equipment, and tools.

Towable and maneuverable in confined hangar spaces.

Load bearing capacity to hold WP-3D tires and wheel components.

This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to determine the market capability of sources or obtain information. It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services discussed in this notice. Any formal solicitation that may subsequently be issued will be announced separately through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.



All information received will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Please do not submit any proprietary or classified information.



Purpose

The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information related to aircraft engine maintenance overhaul services for the Rolls Royce Tay 611-8 turbofan engine (Engine S/N 16613 and 16610)and the availability of loaner Tay 611-8 engines to use while the engine overhaul occurs for NOAA&rsquo;s Gulfstream IVSP (G-IVSP) aircraft.



Introduction

The NOAA Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational line offices of the NOAA.  Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD, and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains, and manages operational assets, including ships, aircraft, and uncrewed systems to be used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA&rsquo;s prioritized airborne requirements.



Background

OMAO operates aircraft in support of various NOAA operational and research projects.  One re-occurring mission is the Hurricane Surveillance mission, required by NOAA&rsquo;s National Weather Service (NWS) and its sub-entities, the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC).  The Surveillance mission collects wind field and other meteorological data on a synoptic scale in the vicinity of a hurricane.  The data from these missions significantly improve life and property-saving information, including tropical cyclone track and intensity forecasts, watches, warnings, and storm surge products. NOAA owns and operates a Gulfstream IV aircraft, N49RF, S/N 1246, supporting high altitude weather surveillance. (Aircraft Flight Total Time as of 01 APR 2022 is 9598.0 hours). The GIV conducts Hurricane Synoptic Surveillance missions supporting National Weather Service storm requirements in the summer and fall and Winter Storm Surveillance missions in the winter and spring. The aircraft is based in Lakeland, FL. The aircraft is maintained in accordance with the Gulfstream manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended Operations System Package I and II maintenance program and is on a Computerized Maintenance Program (CMP) calendar inspection program. Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation in Savannah, Georgia (and other Gulfstream Service Center locations) is the primary vendor responsible for providing the required scheduled and drop-in maintenance support. Light maintenance is performed in-house by NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Airframe and Powerplant Mechanics.



Description of the requirement

The Contractor shall provide complete overhaul service for two Rolls Royce Tay 611-8 Turbo Fan engines as removed from the aircraft in accordance with the Rolls Royce standard overhaul maintenance procedures. The engines will be removed from the aircraft at a maintenance facility in Savannah, GA, and this maintenance event will occur sometime during the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2023. The Contractor shall provide an optional shipping service for two engines from and back to the engine removal facility. The Government may elect to provide its&rsquo; own shipping service if it is advantageous to do so. Loaner engines may be required, and NOAA requests a quote as an optional item in the event loaner engines are required during the period the Government-owned engines are being overhauled. The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, special tools, and facilities to include the most cost-effective support package. The Contractor shall inspect the engines according to Rolls Royce standard maintenance overhaul procedures as per the engine maintenance manuals. After the initial inspection, the Contractor shall report discrepancies, component conditions, and recommendations for items that fall outside the acceptable component tolerance limits. The Contractor shall recommend corrective action to NOAA with a quote for the recommended action. NOAA shall approve all over and above actions outside the standard overhaul scope prior to the Contractor performing any additional work. The Government requests the option to replace out-of-tolerance components with new and/or overhauled parts and requests a quote for both options. After the vendor completes all necessary work, the engines shall be returned to service by the repair station performing the work. The vendor will be responsible for the costs of engine certification run expenses after installation onto N49RF to ensure engine overhaul maintenance actions are of satisfaction to the Government. In addition, the Contractor shall comply with all Mandatory Service Bulletins, Technical Instructions, Airworthiness Directives (FAA), Modifications, Technical Variances, and Repair Instructions required by Rolls Royce, the component manufacturer, and the FAA.



The Contractor shall also provide a complete set of required FAA documentation and a detailed final report as part of the overhaul service. This includes but is not limited to AA Form 337 for major alteration and repairs, authorized release certificate from the repair station, test cell records, and teardown reports. The following is a list of minimum documents to be provided by the Contractor:

1.) Release Certificate

2.) FAA Form #337

3.) Test Certificate

4.) Conformity Certificate

5.) Group &ldquo;A&rdquo; Parts/Engine Build Log

6.) Accessory Log Sheet

7.) Disassembly Inspection Report

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF) to identify potential sources to perform C-20/C-37 Depot Maintenance.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation. 



Program Description:  The C-20/C-37 platforms are militarized versions of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness-certificated Gulfstream aircraft.  The C-20/C-37 fleets are maintained to FAA-approved maintenance standards.  All depot maintenance and repairable spares repair is performed at a Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 145 FAA-certified repair stations. Depot Maintenance would require collaboration with Gulfstream Aerospace, as they are currently on contract to provide most spare parts in support of the Depot Maintenance.  The C-20 is a Gulfstream GIV, powered by twin Rolls Royce MK-611 TAY engines.  The C-37 is a Gulfstream GV and G550, powered by twin Rolls Royce BR-710 engines. C-37 engines are currently supported through Rolls Royce Corporate Care Program. Contractor will be required to do general engine maintenance but overhauls are accomplished through Rolls Royce. These aircraft are equipped with specialized mission communication stations (MCS) as well as defensive systems.  The C-20/C-37 missions are two-fold: (1) provide worldwide airlift support for senior military leaders and Government officials; (2) Navy and Marine C-20G aircraft, equipped with a cargo door, to primarily provide long range, medium airlift, logistics support. Contractors shall be required to gain Computerized Maintenance Program (CMP) access. CMP is the fleet configuration control program and all maintenance actions, serialized control tracked items, and information must be entered into the system to certify maintenance completion. The fleet is projected to require 10+ scheduled depot inductions per year with up to 5 aircraft inducted simultaneously.  There is also potential for unscheduled depot drop-ins during this time period.  



In addition, all contractor workforce personnel who are required to handle Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI) marked as CRYPTO on C-20 and C-37 aircraft must possess and maintain a SECRET security clearance.



Any resultant contract would be considered a service contract where the Service Contract Labor Standard applies and would require the DFARs 252.223-7999, Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors (Deviation 2021-O0009).

This is a notice of the Government&rsquo;s intent to issue a sole source award contract to Intertrade, A Collins Aerospace Company for the procurement of a TACAN transceiver for the C-37B aircraft.  The TACAN is an identification friend or foe (IFF) system and is required to support the C-37B Commandant Gulfstream Aircraft.  The use of this system provides standardization and commonality among U.S. Coast Guard Aircraft.  The USCG announces its intent to enter into a contract award on a sole source basis with Intertrade, A Collins Aerospace Company under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

The specific requirements that makes Intertrade, A Collins Aerospace Company the only contractor capable of providing the TACAN transceiver is that they are the OEM of this system.  To procure this system from another manufacturer would delay production and along with the cost of developing all new software to meet the current TACAN specifications, would be cost prohibitive.

Respondents are advised that the USCG will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice.  All costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the responding party&rsquo;s expense.

This notice of intent is NOT a request for proposals or quotations.

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at Lakeland, FL operates two WP-3D Orions and a Gulfstream GIV-SP in support of hurricane surveillance and scientific research. 



These aircraft&rsquo;s engines are started through the use of high pressure air. Normally this is supplied through an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) on the aircraft that can be started on its own power. However, the APUs are starting to fail at a higher rate due to the age of the aircraft. In the event of an APU failure, the engines can still be started with an external Air Start Cart. By procuring an airstart cart unit that would be readily available at all times, AOC can prevent mission delays and continue to meet the critical demands of our hurricane surveillance stakeholders in the event of an APU failure.

The air start unit will not require heavy usage, therefore a serviceable used unit should fulfill the requirements of this request

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

	NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)


The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:


	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.
	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.
	Identify constraints in transparency and process.





	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.





	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer&rsquo;s decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.





	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman&rsquo;s authority, for instance:





	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).
	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.
	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.
	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA&rsquo;s agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program 

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.  

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.  

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTSUnited States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.
Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCGprocurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the followinginformation to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests inless than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filedwithin the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.
Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to theContracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.
The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential sustainment support sources.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Commercial Derivative Aircraft Division (AFLCMC/WVV) issued a solicitation for the current Engineering Services Contract, contract number FA8106-16-D-0006 in FY16, to provide an Engineering Services contract vehicle for the C20/C37 fleet. This contract awarded as sole source to Gulfstream.  This effort is only to increase the ceiling on the current sole source C20/C37 Engineering Sustainment Contract (ESC); FA8106-16-D-0006.  The current contract period of performance (PoP) runs through 31 Jan 21 unless the six month option to extend is exercised and then the PoP will run through 31 Jul 21.  This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation).  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research.

These efforts must be accomplished by Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) qualified personnel with the technical knowledge, certification credentials &amp; experience, internal support structure, security clearances, and OEM design data which is provided in a technically sound and timely manner to increase aircraft availability and decrease life-cycle costs. 
The contractor will provide support for a multi-service fleet of Air Force, Army, and Navy C-20 and C-37 aircraft.  The C-20 and C-37 fleets consist of commercial derivative Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (GAC) aircraft of model types GIV, GIV-SP, GV, and G550.  This support may also include other Government agencies operating Gulfstream aircraft. The C-20 fleet began service in 1987 and the C-37 fleet began service in 1997. 
The services to be acquired consist of recurring and non-recurring tasks.  Below are specific descriptions of recurring and non-recurring tasks:
1.  Recurring Tasks: Service Literature Review, Unique Drawing and Documents File, Configuration Status Accounting Reporting (aircraft, engine, &amp; software), Engineering Assignment (EA) Data File, EA Status Reporting,  Computerized Maintenance Program (CMP) Access, Proposed Tasks Tracking, Technical Inquiries and Tracking, Contract Funds Status Report, Maintain C-20/37 Web Sites, Field Service Representatives,  Technical/Maintenance Manuals Support and subscriptions services for required commercial off the shelf (COTS) manuals and aircraft database updates.

3d1fd68c0651a6a055126447401a8c94,MDA18DTSPN09,Procurement of Used Aircraft for Modernization of Missile Defense Agency's High Altitude Observatory (HALO) Systems," 
Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to execute a modification to its existing contract HQ0147-11-D-0014 with  L-3 Communications Integrated Systems(7500 Maehr, WACO TX 76705), to add scope and contract value for procurement of used aircraft. The existing contract requires L-3 to maintain and operate a fleet of specialized Government-owned Gulfstream II-B (G-IIB) aircraft which are sensor-equipped to collect electro-optic and infared image data during MDA test events. Each of these sensor- equipped G-IIB aircraft comprises one complete High Altitude Observatory (HALO) system. The Government intends to task L-3 in the 2018 - 2021 timeframe to modernize the Government-owned HALO systems, which will require L-3 to replace the aging G-IIB aircraft with more modern aircraft that meet specialized HALO   requirements.  L-3 procurement of used aircraft (versus new) will satisfy the Government's minimum needs and  will keep operational costs within Budget constraints. After the scope and value is added to contract HQ0147-11- D-0014, L-3 will execute up to three (3) used aircraft procurements in accordance with task orders issued by the Government.

All information received will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Please do not submit any proprietary or classified information.
 
Purpose
 
The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about the capability and availability of purchasing up to two (2) high-altitude jet aircraft, with necessary modifications, to replace NOAA/AOC's Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft, providing reliability and redundancy in performing the critical missions currently executed on the G-IVSP.
 
Introduction
 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA. Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA's prioritized airborne requirements.
 
Background
 
The aircraft of the NOAA/AOC are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's environment. NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around the world over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic pack ice. These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data essential to their research.
The AOC owns, operates and maintains a Gulfstream G-IVSP (serial number 1246, tail designation N49RF), a highly modified twin-jet aircraft, primarily supporting two of NOAA's five Line Offices, the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) office. NWS works to provide weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enhancement of the national economy. OAR provides both the research foundation for understanding the complex systems that support our planet, and the unbiased science to better manage the environment, nationally and globally.  While the G-IVSP has the infrastructure to support a wide variety of instrumentation and mission capabilities, its primary data collection equipment is designed to measure vertical atmospheric profiles using dropwindsonde expendables, 3-dimensional wind fields in the presence of radar returns using the Tail Doppler Radar, and flight level in-situ state parameters (pressure, temperature, humidity and winds) with fuselage-mounted sensors.
Manufactured in 1994, the aircraft is exhibiting higher failure rates and reduced reliability, along with longer and more expensive maintenance cycles.  To avoid further loss of mission performance and reduction in availability, OMAO is seeking to replace this aircraft with a new platform that has no less than the NOAA G-IVSP's performance and capabilities.
When the NOAA G-IVSP was acquired there were gaps between its capabilities and the full set of NOAA science and operational mission requirements.  With the increased capabilities of the current generation of high-altitude business jets, there is the opportunity to better fulfill these mission requirements.  To that end, many of the specifications listed below consist of a minimum acceptable capability and a performance enhancement above or a desired capability in addition to that minimum.
This RFI is issued to gauge industry interest as well as aircraft availability for this requirement.
 
Aircraft Specifications

I.	Base Aircraft Description
 
The basic airframe (&lsquo;green aircraft') shall be a new multi-engine, transport category jet aircraft meeting the requirements of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 25 (14CFR25) and that meets or exceeds the Capabilities listed below.  The aircraft shall have a current and valid U.S. Airworthiness Certificate showing certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to 14CFR21. The aircraft shall be free of any significant damage history during manufacture and modification, and have all mandatory Airworthiness Directives, manufacturer's mandatory Service Bulletins and mandatory Aircraft Service Changes completed before delivery.  All installations / modifications are to be FAA certified to part 25 or the aircraft type certificate whichever is more stringent.  An approved FAA Form 337, or Supplemental Type Certificate, shall accompany all contractor-supplied modifications, to include supporting aeronautical documentation and engineering drawings and schematics.
II. Aircraft Capabilities
The aircraft shall have the following capabilities.  Note that some terminology is based on the current NOAA G-IV; similar characteristics presented in a different format are acceptable, as long as they can be related to the terms listed below:
A.	A service ceiling of at least 45,000 feet International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).  A higher service ceiling is desired.

If not already standard, a multi-level scanning weather radar (examples are the Collins WXR-2100 and the Honeywell RDR-4000), integrated into the cockpit avionics display(s) is desired.  A highly desired enhancement is to provide the radar display at one or more of the cabin seat locations, using a stand-alone display unit.  An additional desired capability is to allow a cabin seat location to control the radar settings (range and tilt) at the pilot's discretion.  These last two desired enhancements are similar to the capability currently available on the NOAA G-IV.
C.	Have interior closeout for cabin lighting and noise reduction, and an externally serviced lavatory.  Provide an Internal Communication System for all cockpit and cabin seating locations, with at least two independent intraship audio channels and the ability to monitor all communication radios from each seating location.  Provide lighting, gaspers, and other Personal Service Unit (PSU) facilities at all cabin seating locations.
D.	Have passenger oxygen (diluter/demand masks with bottle oxygen supply) and other safety infrastructure appropriate for this class of aircraft to operate over water and internationally.  Capacity sufficient to provide 3 hours of emergency oxygen for all cockpit and cabin personnel at a cabin altitude of 25,000 feet is required.
IV. Required Provisions for Scientific Systems
The items on the list below are required, with optional desired enhancements as noted.
A.	Scientific Power
a.	At least 23 KVA of 115V 3-phase, 400 Hz power available for mission systems, higher power capacity from the standard aircraft configuration is desired, but specialized generating equipment is not desired.
b.	At least 4 KVA of 115V single phase 60 Hz power shall be available for mission use, provided by converting a portion of the available 400 Hz mission power.
c.	A minimum of 3 KVA of 115V single phase uninterruptable power (UPS) shall be available for mission use, either derived from the 400 Hz mission power or from a DC source that provides battery backup.

The UPS subsystem shall have a separate manual deactivation switch accessible to the pilot.
f.	Specifics of mission power distribution will be included in the RFP if/when it is issued.
B.	Floor attachments for racks and seats - appropriate seat track or other fittings to allow attachment of mission equipment racks and seats in the cabin.  Desired to have flexibility in certified configurations and attach locations to allow for changing mission equipment requirements.  Wall and/or ceiling attach points may be included if rack weight and Center of Gravity (CG) desired limits necessitate additional attach points.
C.	Satellite Communication
a.	An Inmarsat-based system for voice and data.  Desired enhancement of a dual system for redundancy
i.	Two channels of voice communications, with one handset in the cockpit and at least one in the cabin.  Both channels of audio to be available as listen-only selections on the ICS system.  A desired enhancement is the ability to move location of cabin handset(s) to meet varying cabin configurations.
ii.	Data services with at least the speed provided by SwiftBroadband coupled with a High Gain Antenna, with Ethernet network connection.  Desired enhancement of a higher speed service with similar coverage area and a single provider service, such as Global Xpress.
b.	An Iridium-based system for voice and data
i.	At least one channel of voice communications, with handset in the cabin. Desired enhancements: Second channel with handset in the cockpit, all channels of audio to be available as listen-only selections on the ICS system, and the ability to move location of cabin handset to meet varying cabin configurations.
ii.	Data services of at least 4800 bps with Ethernet network connection.  Desired enhancement of a higher speed service, either through a multi-channel combiner or Iridium-Next.
iii.	Iridium based Sky Connect tracking system with automatic reporting of time stamped position, altitude, ground speed, and ground track information.
D.	Network Infrastructure - Runs of copper and fiber optic network cabling from rack and equipment locations to a patch panel, with provisions for network equipment (routers and/or switches) in the same location (network closet or similar); specifics of cable type, connectors and locations to be determined if/when an RFP is issued.
E.	Tail Doppler Radar (TDR)
a.	Tail-mounted radome to enclose antenna assembly for vertically scanning radar, similar to system installed on NOAA P-3 and G-IVSP.  Includes vertical mounting plate for antenna pedestal base.  The minimum radome size is sufficient to house current G-IVSP antenna assembly (current radome is approx. 44 inches interior diameter); radome to accommodate larger antenna assembly is desired, but may need to evaluate tradeoff with performance loss due to increased drag.
b.	Dual X-band (WR-112 or WR-90) waveguide runs from tail pedestal to pressurized cabin, including penetration of aft pressure bulkhead.  Wiring run (motor drive and position, specific wire types and quantities to be determined if/when an RFP is issued) from pedestal to pressurized cabin, including bulkhead connector at aft pressure bulkhead.
c.	Depending on aircraft layout and limitations, it may be desired to mount TDR electronics (approx. 45 inches of vertical 19 inch EIA/ECA-310 rack space) in an aft baggage compartment to minimize waveguide length and reduce cabin noise. If not mounted in the baggage compartment, additional waveguide runs to the equipment location in the main cabin will be required.
F.	Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS)The AVAPS consists of an expendable unit (the dropsonde), a launch chute assembly in the aircraft, antennas for telemetry (400 MHz VHF, mounted under the aircraft) and GPS (L1/L2 band, mounted on top of aircraft), and a receiver/processor system, which is rack mounted in the cabin.  More information about the AVAPS can be found at https://www.eol.ucar.edu/node/10082.
a.	A dropsonde launch chute is required, with location and design determined to allow for launch of expendables with adequate separation from the aircraft and without excessive g-loads or tumbling upon launch.  If the launch chute location is in the baggage compartment or other area with limited access, it is anticipated that the Government would provide an automated launcher similar to that used on the NCAR HIAPER aircraft, to be attached to the chute provided.  It is likely that the smaller &lsquo;mini' dropsonde (1.75 inches diameter, by approx. 12 inches long) would be used, rather than the larger dropsonde currently used on the NOAA G-IVSP.
b.	Installation of up-looking (GPS) and down-looking (VHF Telemetry) antennas, with coaxial cabling to a cabin location to be determined if/when an RFP is issued.  Antenna locations to be selected to maximize field of view and minimize coaxial cable distance to AVAPS rack-mounted receiver equipment.
V. Optional Provisions for Scientific Systems
The following items may be listed as either optional or required if a solicitation is issued:
A.	Cabin Seats - track-mounted, with fore-aft, lateral and vertical adjustments, FAA certified for takeoff and landing, with four- or five-point restraint systems.  Quantity to be determined by cabin layout and number of unique seat types (e.g. if seats are designed for left- or right-side only).
B.	Equipment Racks - single-bay, conforming to 19"" EIA/ECA-310 standards, minimum of 44"" vertical height (higher is desired), minimum of 386 lbs. weight capacity with CG 25"" above floor, decreasing to a minimum of 200 lbs. with equipment CG 47"" above the floor, higher weight and CG limits desired, but not at the expense of excessive rack frame weight.  Racks and rack limits are to be certified for FAA-required aircraft g-loads.  Quantity to be determined by cabin layout and number of unique rack types (e.g. if racks are designed for left- or right-side only).
C.	Wing Hard Points - Up to six wing stations (three on each side) with threaded holes and wiring to allow for mounting pylons and instrument pods.  Highly desired that the mounting provisions and capabilities be identical to the wing hard points on the NCAR HIAPER aircraft.  See the HIAPER Investigator's Handbook https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/nsfncar-hiaper-investigator-handbook, Chapter 5 for more information.
D.	Fuselage Mounting Provisions - Some combination of Aperture Pads and Plates (approx. 7""x10"" opening), Mounts (plates for attaching inlets, etc.), Pads (plates with 2"" diameter hole for sensors), Window Blanks, and Optical View Ports (20.5"" ports) is desired.  Specific types, quantities and locations are to be determined if/when an RFP is issued.  It is highly desired that each type conform to the form factor and load capabilities of the equivalent provision on NCAR HIAPER aircraft, although the quantity and specific locations may vary from the HIAPER configuration.  See the HIAPER Investigator's Handbook https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/nsfncar-hiaper-investigator-handbook, Chapter 5 for more information.
E.	Secondary launch chute - Provisions for a launch chute in the cabin area, consisting of a circular tube from the floor to the external skin, approximately 7"" internal diameter, angled similar to the chute on N49RF.  Initial delivery would be with a plug installed that was flat to the cabin floor and contoured to the external skin.  Provisions for installing a pressurized launch mechanism (e.g. circular flange at floor level with mounting holes) would be required, but the actual launch mechanism would not be included.
VI. Aircraft Availability
The desired time frame is delivery of the base (green) aircraft with Equipment and Required Provisions (as stated in Sections III and IV above) within 18 months of Contract award.  It is understood that Enhanced and Optional provisions may extend that time line.

 Aerodynamic Flow Field and Load Calculations
Background
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory&rsquo;s (PNNL) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Aerial Observation Capability (Air-ARM) project is evaluating aircraft to replace the Gulfstream G-159 (G-1) aircraft used to support the US Department of Energy (DOE) ARM Aerial Facility (AAF).
The Bombardier CRJ-200, Q200, Q300, ATR-42, and Embraer ERJ-135 are the aircraft that potentially meet the requirements of the Air-ARM project.
Once a replacement aircraft is acquired it will be modified for atmospheric research. The modifications will likely include installation of under-wing mounted pylons, fuselage mounted pylons, and window pass throughs/attachment points. Free airstream sensors will be mounted onto the pylons and window attachment points.
For examples see https://www.flickr.com/photos/armgov/albums/72157623918331175.
Scope Description
Free airstream sensors need to be mounted in locations where flow disturbances are minimal and/or well characterized. To this end, aerodynamic flow field calculations shall be carried out for the aircraft above applicable to a range of airspeeds and various angles of attack. 
Once optimal locations for free airstream sensors has been determined, aerodynamic loads shall be calculated for attachments, pylons and idealized shapes of the free airstream sensors. The load calculations shall be performed for a range of airspeeds and angles of attack.

20ff8f1f5ff93858c9f3e7c120346026,80JSC018GVSAR,NASA Gulfstream GV Synthetic Aperture Radar Request for Information (RFI),"The purpose of this amendment 1 to notice 80JSC018GVSAR is to post questions and answers received.  The due date for responses has not been extended.  There is no solicitation available at this time; all information presented is preliminary.Q1: In reference to that RFI, we understand the requested limit for responses is 15 pages. Does this page limit include: ""2) Provide examples, if any, of existing antenna/radome/fuselage pod designs completed on aircraft other than Gulfstreams via sketches, drawings, or photographs"" (reference Section 3.0 of the RFI instructions)? Given that some drawing packages may be sizeable based on the level of detail provided and that originals may not be on 8.5"" x 11"" paper, are multiple pages allowed to facilitate other size drawing?A1: The requested sketches, drawings, and photographs are not included in the page limitation.Q2: We understand that two (2) SAR antenna/radomes would be mounted on the Port (LH) side of the aircraft. If fuselage mounted, can we assume that the antennas can be mounted in-line (i.e. end to end) and the overall panel would be approximately 25"" x 140"" long overall?A2: The antennas can be mounted in-line (end to end) as long as they are canted ~45 degrees from vertical and have a clear view of the ground.Q3: Can the antennas be mounted side by side making a panel that is approximately 50""x 70""?A3: There are no technical issues with mounting the antennas side-by-side as long as they are canted ~45 degrees from vertical and have a clear view of the ground.Q4: Are there any special alignment, flatness tolerance, or stiffness requirements for the antenna mounting that need to be considered such that fuselage bending or pressurization in flight that could affect system performance?A4: There are no special alignment requirements assuming the antenna mounting screws will ensure installation repeatability to within a couple millimeters. The antenna mounting and the Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) mounting will be surveyed to determine their absolute locations relative to the aircraft coordinates. The antenna frame itself will ensure antenna flatness and stiffness. The INU will monitor any antenna movements caused by fuselage bending or pressurization in flight.Q5: If the antennas are to be wing mounted, will they need to be mounted both on the Port (LH) side or can the antennas be separated with one mounted on each wing (LH &amp; RH Wing pods with both antenna arrays pointing in the port (LH) direction)?A5: The government envisioned that a two wing-pod solution would include antennas mounted on each wing with the arrays point in the port direction.Q6: Are there any Field of View (FOV) requirements emanating from the face of the panels that need to be considered?A6: There should be an unobstructed Field of View of the ground emanating from the face of the antenna panels. Q7: If the antennas are mounted within wing pods, will each pod have an LN-251 INS/GPS?A7: Each antenna, no matter where it is mounted, will have an LN-251 INS/GPS installed with it.Q8: Are there any distance restrictions between the LN-251 and the antennas?A8: There is no specific distance restrictions between the LN-251 (or comparable INU)and the antenna as long as the two units are mechanically tightly coupled with a rigid structure such that the INU will experience the same vibrations, fuselage bending and expansion as the antenna frame. Q9: Are there any distance restrictions between the antenna and the cabin rack mounted equipment?A9: No.Q10: Do the antennas require any special cooling provisions?A10: The L-band active array antenna may require cooling in low altitude flights, but no cooling is required for high altitude flights (&gt; 26kft). So the answer is TBD.Q11: The provided figure of the antenna panel indicates that the external face is a radome surface. Does the antenna require a radome over this face or is the intent that the face as shown on the provided figure be exposed to free air?A11: The antenna radome is required.Q12: Can an alternate radome be proposed?A12: While the government would like to use the current antenna/radome to limit upgrade costs, the purpose of this RFI is to obtain data from industry that might be useful and does not limit vendors from highlighting alternative solutions.Q13: What certification status shall the aircraft have at the completion of the modification effort?A13: All permanent, major designs and modifications to the aircraft shall have DER signed, FAA Form 8110-3s associated with them. These Form 8110-33 will serve as the foundation for the submittal of a Form 337 to the Houston FSDO.Q14: What is the envisioned period of performance?A14: Up to four years.Q15: Shall both antennae be aimed in the same direction?A15: Yes, port-looking, 45-deg down from the horizon.Q16: What is the preferred arrangement of the antennae? (Side-by-side, in-line tandem, etc.) What arrangements other than the preferred one are acceptable?A16: There is no preferred arrangement of antennae so long as the arrangement meets the high level requirements noted in the RFI.",Johnson Space Center,2018-01-23 19:28:01+00:00,2018-01-23,2018-02-09 05:59:00+00:00,2018-02-09,,Special Notice,,336413,Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing ,16,Aerospace Craft Components And Accessories,Contracting Officer,Audrey C.

d6bc35724ca867db951a979200e6f049,80JSC018R0008,Gulfstream Nadir Viewport Installation (GVNVI),"This is modification 3 to the synopsis entitled Gulfstream V Nadir Viewport Installation (GVNVI), 80JSC018R008, which was posted on 12/11/2017. You are notified that the following changes are made to the synopsis: questions and answers are provided below and amendment 1 to the RFP is attached.The following changes have been made to the RFP:  1. the proposal submission due date has been extended from Friday, January 19, 2018, to Thursday, January 25, 2018, and 2. Statement of Work section 5.9 has been updated.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).Q20: Since this is commercial items contract, will the government be providing quality assurance from the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)?A20: NASA does not intend to solicit DCMA quality assurance help for this project. NASA does intend to provide contractor surveillance activities per SOW Section 4.3 and Inspection clauses outlined in the Terms and Conditions sections of the RFP.Q21: Will NASA provide the optical viewport pressure plugs for flight testing?
A21: No. Per SOW 5.1.4, the Contractor is responsible for providing optical viewport pressure plugs. Also, note that the Contractor provided pressure plugs are the FAA certificated configuration. SOW Section 5.9 has been updated to clarify ground and flight test requirements.
Q22: Are the optical viewport windows acrylic?
A22: No, per SOW 5.1.3, the optical viewport windows are glass.
Q23: What is driving the optical window fuselage stations of FS 290.5 &amp; FS 339.5?
A23: NASA based the locations on existing GV aircraft with similar optical viewport modifications.
Q24: It is understood NASA is leveraging a previous modification on another GV aircraft. Is NASA willing to consider alternative Nadir window solutions?
A24: NASA has already completed a significant amount of work (e.g. floor modification design and window pack assembly design) based on the design requirements presented in the SOW. Although NASA is interested in creative solutions, the Contractor's proposed solution must meet SOW requirements.
Q25: Does NASA need to keep the existing oxygen bottle size, i.e. could a smaller oxygen bottle be installed?
A25: No, a smaller oxygen bottle may not be installed. Per SOW Section 5.2.1, the existing oxygen bottle will need to be relocated.
Q26: In the Statement of Work, page 9 of 24, Footnote 1, states that NASA will modify the floor structure prior to aircraft delivery. Will the technical data package be made available to the GV Nadir Port contractor in the event it is relevant to the design approach?
A26: Yes, NASA will provide the Contractor all modification drawings for the floor structure.
Q27: In the Statement of Work, page 10 of 24, Footnote 3, states NASA will provide a window pack assembly with a single and double pane configuration. Must the contractor proposed solution accommodate both solutions or is one intended for FWD and the other for AFT configurations.
A27: The Contractor's solution must accommodate both a single and double pane configuration. NASA does not intend for the window pack assemblies to be port specific. The window pack structural interface to the aircraft will be the same for both viewports and the window packs may be installed in either viewport. See drawings 25-0000054 and 25-0000055 in the solicitation technical library. Although not currently shown in drawings 25-0000054 and 25-0000055, NASA plans to design the window pack to support both a single and dual window configuration by revising the design of the window stack structure.
Q28: In the Terms and Conditions Document, section 52.212-1, paragraph (c) (page 2 of 60), states prices must be held for 30 days. However Section 52.212-1 paragraph (m) (page 6 of 60) states prices must be held for 120 days. Can you please clarify how long the offer must hold prices with the proposal submission?
A28: In accordance with 52.212-1(c), the offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph (m) of the addendum to 52.212-1, the offeror shall agree to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.
Q29: We request a 5 day extension to the proposal due date in order to review OEM manuals, mature our design approach and better identify potential risk items, considering this to be a FFP contract.
A29: Based on industry feedback, NASA has extended the proposal due date from Friday, January 19, to Thursday, January 25, 2018.
Q30: Can you please clarify Terms and Conditions, Section 52.216-90, page 45 of 60? It states the maximum ordering limit is $1,000,000. Does this mean the contract value cannot exceed $1,000,000 or that no single item (labor or ODC) may exceed $1,000,000?
A30: Clause 52.216-90, IDIQ MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM ORDERING LIMITS (AUG 2013) (JSC PROCUREMENT INSTRUCTION), will only apply to Time-and-Material (T&amp;M) task orders issued under the resulting contract. The cumulative value of all T&amp;M task orders issued shall not exceed $1,000,000.
Q31: Regarding the RFP to install Nadir portals in a GV aircraft, is access to Gulfstream specific data a requirement? If Gulfstream data is not available to the Contractor, will it be acceptable to do a detailed survey of the aircraft to obtain all necessary geometry and configuration data to begin the project?
A31: NASA does not require that the Contractor have access to original GV technical data such as drawings as long as the Contractor has a feasible engineering plan to obtain the necessary technical data required for the modification. The Contractor will need to have access to some Gulfstream data such maintenance manuals for aircraft disassembly, reassembly, calibration, and system checkout.

6772901ae3ba1433e3616723cfb5ef3a,80JSC017GVDIV,Gulfstream V Nadir Viewport Installation,"This is modification 3 to the synopsis titled Gulfstream V Nadir Viewport Installation (GVNVI), Solicitation Number 80JSC017GVDIV, which was originally posted on July 21, 2017. The purpose of this modification is to revise the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this synopsis, from 488190 - Other Support Activities for Air Transportation to 336411 - Aircraft Manufacturing.
After careful consideration of the requirements, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) has determined that the general scope of services to be provided for the Gulfstream V viewport installations are those services generally defined within the NAICS system as provided in industry Sector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing, rather than Sector 488 for Support Activities for Transportation.
NASA JSC anticipates awarding the GVNVI contract to a firm that primarily provides one or more of the following: (1) manufacturing or assembling complete aircraft; (2) developing and making aircraft prototypes; (3) aircraft conversion (i.e., major modifications to systems); and (4) complete aircraft overhaul and rebuilding (i.e., periodic restoration of aircraft to original design specifications).
The Government's market research suggests that the specific NAICS code of 336411, Aircraft Manufacturing, would best represent the primary services to be provided under the anticipated GVNVI contract. Based on the selection of NAICS code 336411, it is anticipated that the GVNVI solicitation will be a small business set-aside.

IntroductionThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA.  Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA's prioritized airborne requirements.
PurposeThe purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about the capability and availability of purchasing one (1) multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft, with necessary modifications, to replace NOAA/AOC's Gulfstream Turbo Commander, AC695A aircraft, with the option to purchase a second multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft to support NOAA/OMAO's national mission.  The purchased aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's King Air 350CER (serial number FM21) for safety and standardization.
BackgroundThe aircraft of the NOAA/AOC are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's environment.  NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around the world over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic pack ice.  These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data essential to their research.
The AOC provides capable, mission-ready aircraft and professional crews to the scientific community wherever and whenever they are required. Whether studying global climate change or acid rain, assessing marine mammal populations, surveying coastal erosion, investigating oil spills, or improving hurricane prediction models, the AOC flight crews continue to operate in some of the world's most demanding flight regimes.
The AOC operates and maintains a Gulfstream Turbo Commander (AC695A, serial number 96089), a highly modified twin turboprop aircraft, supporting NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NWS works to provide weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enchantment of the national economy.  Manufactured in 1984, the airframe is over 30 years old and due to aging costs, standardization issues, and loss of mission readiness, OMAO is seeking to replace this aircraft.
The AOC also operates and maintains a Hawker-Beechcraft King Air 350CER (B300C, serial number FM21), another highly modified twin-turboprop aircraft that was acquired in 2007 (WC133M07CN0231), supporting NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NOS works to observe, understand, and manage our Nation's coastal and marine resources. NOS measures and predicts coastal and ocean phenomena, protects large areas of the oceans, works to ensure safe navigation, and provides tools and information to protect and restore coastal and marine resources.   NOAA's requirements have grown over the past ten (10) years and a single aviation platform cannot support all the flight hours that NOS requests every year.  Additionally, this aircraft serves as a single point of failure for the collection of rapid response damage assessment following storms that impact the United States and its territories and the requirement for a backup aircraft exists for the Nation.  For these reasons, OMAO is seeking to expand its fleet of aircraft.
AOC is replacing the Turbo Commander with a multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft(s) capable of efficiently flying the profiles required by NWS and the other line offices in NOAA.   AOC is also contemplating expanding its fleet and capabilities by acquiring an additional King Air 350.The prospective aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's existing King Air 350CER, serial number FM21, for safety and standardization.  This Sources Sought / RFI is issued to gage industry interest as well as aircraft availability for this requirement.

fac5eb7999823755cf322836b11aaf3e,NNJ17ZBR004R,Rolls-Royce Engine Management Program,"NASA/JSC recently acquired a Gulfstream GV aircraft for long-range transport to support both the astronaut direct crew return mission as well as ongoing requirements in NASA's Earth Science Division (ESD). The aircraft is powered by two Rolls-Royce BR710 high-bypass turbofan engines. Due to the time-sensitive, global nature of the GV's mission set, the Aircraft Operations Division (AOD) requires a comprehensive engine maintenance plan that provides for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repair work, loaner engine delivery and installation, continuous engine monitoring, and overhaul support. NASA AOD has a long and successful history of operating and maintaining other Gulfstream aircraft and associated engines.
NASA/JSC intends to purchase the Rolls Royce Corporate Care (RRCC) program, on a sole-source basis, to Rolls-Royce. RRCC is exclusive to Rolls-Royce and not available by any other source. Some discrete elements of the support provided as part of RRCC are available on the aircraft engine service market; however, RRCC is the only service available that provides all of the required elements for complete Rolls-Royce BR710 high-bypass turbofan engine maintenance and lifecycle sustainment. Due to the global, time-critical nature of the missions that will be performed by the GV, the ability of Rolls-Royce to provide immediate, worldwide support as part of this program is a unique and critical aspect of the program.
The Government does intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of technically acceptable low bids and past performance.  The relative importance of the factors is as follows: a technically acceptable low bid is more important than past performance.
Past Performance: The offeror shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.  Information shall be provided on either: 1) all such contracts within the past three years or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.  The Offeror should not describe past performance history in the quote.  The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them.  The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other Offerors.  The offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.
This announcement will close at 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on September 28, 2016.  Questioning pertaining to this RFQ must be submitted in writing to James Rall at email james.rall@noaa.gov and andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov.  Telephonic requests will not be honored.  Quotes may be submitted via electronic means (email) to james.rall@noaa.gov and andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov by the date and time listed above.
