6f063caf8d43418ea9e3eae069e19eb1,N00019-20-RFPREQ-PMA-290-0947,P-8A Outer Mold Line (OML) Airworthiness Flight Evaluation and Post Analysis,"The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) delivery order for the supplies and services required to install and integrate safe for flight artifacts, develop flight evaluations and analyze post flight data in order to provide flight certification for an Outer Mold Line (OML) change on the P-8A aircraft. The period of performance is 12 September 2023 through 11 September 2026.

The effort was procured pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, &quot;Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.&quot;  The Boeing P-8A team, consisting of the Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) and Integrated Development Systems (IDS) Divisions, is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the OML change and therefore, only Boeing can meet the agency&rsquo;s need in the required timeframe.

It was determined that a CPFF contract action was the appropriate contract type pursuant to DFARS 235.006(b)(ii)(A). This is a development program with uncertainties related to the OML change making CPFF applicable and a fixed-price type contract inapplicable.
