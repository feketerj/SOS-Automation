INTRODUCTION:

The PEO Aviation and Army Contracting Command &ndash; Redstone Arsenal (ACC-RSA) Space, Missile Defense, and Special Programs (SMD/SP) Directorate requests that industry partners interested in this opportunity provide feedback (both positive and negative) on the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) designated Draft RFP contract line item number (CLIN) structure, basic contract scope of work (SOW), Draft RFP Section L instructions, and Draft RFP Section M evaluation criteria, as well as Draft RFP data rights information, for the development and capabilities demonstration of three (3) High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES)  prototypes, which will be released via DoD SAFE to all respondents that are assessed as meeting the security qualifications for this requirement that are discussed below.

Additionally, the USG will participate in the Army Aviation Association of America (Quad A) Symposium to be held at in Nashville, TN, on April 24-26, 2023. During this event, the USG intends to hold one-on-one sessions with all respondents who are assessed as meeting the security requirements detailed in this notice; respondents cleared will be provided an opportunity to attend a one-on-one session and will receive a copy of the above-stated Draft RFP documents beforehand. The appointment times for the one-on-one sessions will be coordinated after the Draft RFP documents are released to respondents who meet the security requirements stated in this notice.

The USG will evaluate all responses to this special notice to assess each respondent&rsquo;s ability to meet the security requirements stated below; responses will be evaluated to determine if they meet the security requirements and will be given an &ldquo;Acceptable/Unacceptable&rdquo; assessment. Once security qualification responses have been vetted, all respondents to this notice will be notified of their acceptable/unacceptable assessment; in the case of an &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; assessment, the respondent may be asked to clarify any issues that led to the &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; assessment. Respondents that received an acceptable assessment will be notified via email and receive instructions to access the CUI designated Draft RFP documents via DoD SAFE.

PLANNED ACQUISITION APPROACH:

The USG is exploring soliciting and awarding a single award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) basic contract for the development and capabilities demonstration of three (3) HADES prototypes The anticipated base ordering period is five (5) years, with seven (7), 12-month optional ordering periods, for a potential of a total 12 year ordering period consisting of firm-fixed-priced, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost reimbursement CLINs.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:

The USG has a requirement for the integration, test, system validation, initial operation, and delivery of multiple Government-furnished Bombardier 6500 aircraft. HADES will be an integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system, and have a base set of modifications made by the manufacturer. HADES will be a sub-component of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council-validated Multi-Domain Sensing System and serves a key enabler to Army Long-Range Precision Fires by directly mitigating deep-sensing gaps in Large Scale Combat Operations. HADES will have the required altitude and endurance to enable deep sensing of adversary forces and the range to reach an increasingly diverse set of problems in an increasingly connected global threat landscape. Each HADES will constitute one (1) Government-furnished, Global 6500 aircraft, which will be integrated to the HADES system #1 configuration with capabilities that will result in an integrated HADES. A Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) applied early and throughout the HADES system life cycle will strive to achieve the Program Executive Office Aviation MOSA objectives of improved lifecycle affordability, increased readiness, enhanced capabilities, reduced schedule pressure, and reduced supply chain risk.

The highest security level for this effort is TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI).

The contractor shall have a sufficient number of employees with a personnel security clearance at the TS and SECRET levels in order to meet the requirements of the resultant IDIQ basic contract and its task orders. The contractor shall comply with the requirements of the DoD Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254) and shall utilize the HADES Security Classification Guide (SCG) provided by the U.S. Government for classification guidance. The contractor shall have and maintain a TS Facility Security Clearance (FCL) with SECRET safeguarding requirements.

The contractor shall have access to Communications Security (COMSEC) information, SCI, Non-SCI Intelligence information, CUI, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) information. Contractor shall have access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) at contractor and Government facilities, Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) at Government facilities, and National Security Agency Intranet (NSANet) at Government facilities only.

All contractor personnel performing work on the resulting IDIQ basic contract shall possess and maintain a minimum of a SECRET USG security clearance (TS and/or SCI when required at the task order level). Access to NSANet requires a counterintelligence or lifestyle polygraph IAW NSA/CSS Policy 6-21.

Contractor shall have access to classified information at Government and industry facilities while performing this requirement. The contractor is authorized to store up to SECRET classified material in an approved General Services Administration container. The contractor shall comply with the requirements of DoD Instruction 5200.48 for the safeguarding of FOUO and CUI material.

The contractor shall comply with the requirements of Army Regulation 530-1 for operational security.

During HADES performance, the contractor&rsquo;s Facility Security Officer (FSO) will be required to immediately report any actions (positive or negative) taken by the DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility or Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency to the responsible Government contracting officer&rsquo;s representative, senior intelligence officer, and industrial security specialist on their employee(s) supporting the resulting IDIQ basic contract.

Title of Procurement

Rolls-Royce CorporateCare&trade; Program Support Services for aircraft Global 5000, N47. PR# AC-20-03567

Program Office and Point of Contact

Flight Program Operations, Program Support Group, AJF-4100.

Nature of Procurement Action

To provide a continuation of a 5-year, firm fixed price contract the Rolls Royce CorporateCare &trade; program to the follow-on contract DTFACT-16-P-00050, to cover total engine maintenance for power plant parts and support for the ACY Flight Operations Team, AJF-1210 aircraft Global 5000, N47.

Description of Supplies/Services

Rolls-Royce CorporateCare&trade; Program provides comprehensive power plant and component replacement coverage for exchange and repair to engine systems, to include scheduled and unscheduled component parts replacement, 24 Hour delivery service and world-wide coverage of components for the FAA Flight Program&rsquo;s Bombardier Global 5000 aircraft. The Global 5000 is a newer type aircraft with two Rolls-Royce BR700 power plants, the Flight Operations Team needs to ensure comprehensive coverage for power plant parts and service, over and above those that may be still covered by the component manufactures basic warranty. As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Rolls-Royce has developed the CorporateCare&trade; program as a cost effective engine management service that will provide a solution to enable the FAA to forecast with certainty the costs associated with the above-mentioned coverage for the next 5 years, and eliminate the risk of undetermined costs for a replacement or lease power plant should the need arise.

The program covers engine shop visits on qualified equipment suffering a qualified event failure; line replaceable parts coverage including shipping; availability of lease engines during an engine qualified event failure; labor coverage for engine removal and reinstallation associated with a qualified event, as well as, Engine freight and logistics coverage.

Authority

Authority for single source procurement is provided by AMS policy section 3.2.2.4. Cite any other authority if applicable, such as an international agreement.

Rationale Supporting Use of a Single Source

In accordance with the requirements of the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), this document sets forth the basis for the decision to contract on a single source basis with Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd &amp; Co. KG of Blankenfelde-Mahlow, Germany for the subject requirement.  Rolls-Royce is the only known source that can deliver the services described below and is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the BR700 power plants (engines).

On October 13, 2004, the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center awarded a contract to acquire a new Global 5000 aircraft from Bombardier Aerospace Corporation on a full and open competitive basis. This aircraft was delivered to the Technical Center in September 2005. Accordingly, in order to ensure the aircraft&rsquo;s Power plants and components are adequately covered, it has been determined that Rolls-Royce (OEM) is the only known source available to provide the quick response, parts, and support coverage required. Additionally; since no spare engines have been acquired, Rolls Royce Corporate Care provides a lease engine will be made available should the need arise.  This is a valuable asset to this contract as the down time for the aircraft would be minimal.  Procuring an engine that is specific to this aircraft in the least amount of time is crucial as to not impact the FAA&rsquo;s mission.  Additionally, Rolls-Royce continues to provide, at no additional charge, one training course for one student per year for the period of coverage.  No other known service maintenance provider includes this option.

Impact. The FAA Flight Program requires these services to continue to provide airworthy aircraft for R&amp;D, Flight Inspection and Transportation missions. The FAA aircraft are required to respond quickly to national priorities and mission-critical operations. The Flight Program aircraft must be ready for flight in order to complete mission requirements, sometimes at a moment&rsquo;s notice during a national emergency. Only Rolls-Royce provides this comprehensive power plant and component replacement coverage for exchange and repair to the engine systems, to include scheduled and unscheduled component parts replacement, 24 Hour delivery service and world-wide coverage of components for the FAA Flight Program&rsquo;s Bombardier Global 5000 aircraft. Additionally, as the OEM, Rolls-Royce utilizes only factory certified technicians to work on their equipment and will void warranty items if non-factory certified work is performed.  If the subject maintenance and support were not renewed, there could be considerable disruption in aircraft availability resulting in overall interruption and inability to respond to national priorities, mission-critical operations, and national emergencies.

Engine parts purchased on the open market, if available, could be charged at a premium E.G.: to replace a fan compressor wheel could cost about $200K exchange and this would not count the associated labor costs of approximately $18-25K. Under the CorporateCare&trade; program, the Fan Compressor wheel would be covered as a qualifying event, cost about $100K and labor would be included.  In addition, as new mechanics are hired, Rolls Royce will provide, at no additional charge, one training course for one student per year for the period of coverage. No other known service maintenance provider includes this option. Ensuring FAA employees are knowledgeable of our airframes is a key component to the FAA&rsquo;s commitment to safety.

Specialized Expertise. Only Rolls-Royce provides this comprehensive power plant and component replacement coverage for exchange and repair to the engine systems, to include scheduled and unscheduled component parts replacement, 24 Hour delivery service and world-wide coverage of components for the FAA Flight Program&rsquo;s Bombardier Global 5000 aircraft.

Market Analysis

The Flight Operations Maintenance Office, (AJF-2211) to date has found no equivalent or alternative sources for this unique requirement. Market research shows that only Rolls-Royce provides this comprehensive power plant and component replacement coverage for exchange and repair to the engine systems, to include scheduled and unscheduled component parts replacement, 24 Hour delivery service and world-wide coverage of components for the FAA Flight Program&rsquo;s Bombardier Global 5000.

In accordance with AMS policy section 3.2.2.4, Single-Source Selection, a public announcement will be made on beta.SAM.gov to inform the industry about the basis for the decision to contract with Rolls-Royce, via single source procedures.

Other Facts Supporting Use of Single Source

As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Rolls Royce is able to provide engines to the FAA&rsquo;s required delivery schedule without delay.  The OEM has full knowledge of all proprietary data pertaining to their BR700 engines, tooling equipment, and specialized technical teams that are available as needed.

f156de7f3d1e861c75e0171d24cfbb74,35043,MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION for FAA Aircraft Acquisition,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Program Operations (AJF) Service Unit contemplates an aircraft acquisition to standardize the Flight Program Operations current fleet of aircraft.   This market survey will support the first phase of the contemplated acquisition for four used (4) Bombardier Challenger 605/650s over a two (2)-year time period.

The purpose of this market survey/RFI is for the FAA to obtain market research and determine industryâ€™s capability to provide four used Bombardier Challenger 605/650s.  Responses to this market survey will be used to improve the FAAâ€™s understanding of the current market and assist with determining the appropriate acquisition strategy and approach.  The nature of competition for this acquisition has not been determined at this time. 

The following principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is being considered:

336411 - Aircraft Manufacturing

1.  BACKGROUND
The FAAâ€™s Flight Program Operations service unit is responsible for all aspects of FAA Flight Program safety, administration, operations, training, and maintenance. The Flight Program Operations service unit conducts four missions:

  â€¢  Flight Inspection: Flight Program Operations ensures the integrity of instrument approaches and airway procedures that constitute our NAS infrastructure and addresses the Agencyâ€™s international commitments. Flight Program Operations accomplishes this mission through the airborne inspection of all space and ground-based instrument flight procedures and the validation of electronic signals in space transmitted from ground navigation systems. Flight Program Operations also performs inspections for the Department of Defense (DOD) as essential to the defense of the United States both foreign and domestic.

  â€¢  Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) Support: Flight Program Operations conducts flight and ground testing directly related to research, development, test, and evaluation of new electronic aids, air traffic procedures, aircraft improvement, and aviation medical research.

  â€¢  Critical Event Response/Transportation: Flight Program Operations provides transportation required to accomplish official FAA responsibilities in times of emergency or disaster (hurricane response), as well as support the NTSB in carrying out its duties. Flight Program Operations also serves the transportation needs of DOT and FAA senior executives, and other federal agencies under reimbursable agreements, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

  â€¢  Aviation Safety Training: Flight Program Operations provides formal training and currency/proficiency services to aviation safety inspectors and flight test personnel to ensure they remain qualified and current to operate FAA aircraft.

Flight Program Operations is responsible for operating and maintaining a fleet of aircraft to accomplish these missions.  The current fleet is comprised of 40 aircraft (twelve makes/models) with an average age of 23 years, including King Air 300, Lear 60, Challenger 601, Challenger 604, Challenger 605, King Air C90GTi, Bombardier Global Express, and Citation 560XL aircraft.

The FAA contemplates transitioning to a multiple-use aircraft strategy to decrease the number of makes and models.  The FAA assessed the current fleet based on mission, airframe age, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance history, as well as workforce composition and training to determine the recommended make-up of the future fleet.

The FAA contemplates a procurement for four (4) used Bombardier Challenger 605s or 650s via an Indefinite Delivery/Requirements contract to supplement the current fleet of Challenger 605 aircraft.   The FAA has determined that Bombardier Challenger 605/650 meet the the requirement.  This determination is based on the significant investment in operations (pilot) and maintenance training, parts, and tooling, as well as engineering data and support already in place for this airframe which allows the FAA to significantly modify the aircraft (including installation of components that require skin penetration) necessary to meet the FAA mission. The FAA plans to procure Bombardier Challengers over a two (2) year period based on availability of funding and market availability.  The FAA will modify the Challenger 605/650 aircraft to meet multiple FAA mission requirements.  

The requirements for the Bombardier Challenger 605s or 650s are included in Attachment A to this Market Survey. 

2.  MARKET SURVEY/RFI DISCUSSION TOPICS AND SUBMITTAL INFORMATION

Interested vendorsâ€™ responses should address the following topics:

    1.  Provide a description of your business to include company size (large, small, gross receipts, number of employees, etc.); nature of the business; small business designation, if applicable; years in business; and registered North American Industry Classifications (NAICS) codes, if applicable.

20b3dbdac96540e8950f1f516fc1a8f5,451599,Aerodynamic Flow Field and Load Calculations,"SOURCES SOUGHT
 Aerodynamic Flow Field and Load Calculations
Background
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory&rsquo;s (PNNL) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Aerial Observation Capability (Air-ARM) project is evaluating aircraft to replace the Gulfstream G-159 (G-1) aircraft used to support the US Department of Energy (DOE) ARM Aerial Facility (AAF).
The Bombardier CRJ-200, Q200, Q300, ATR-42, and Embraer ERJ-135 are the aircraft that potentially meet the requirements of the Air-ARM project.
Once a replacement aircraft is acquired it will be modified for atmospheric research. The modifications will likely include installation of under-wing mounted pylons, fuselage mounted pylons, and window pass throughs/attachment points. Free airstream sensors will be mounted onto the pylons and window attachment points.
For examples see https://www.flickr.com/photos/armgov/albums/72157623918331175.
Scope Description
Free airstream sensors need to be mounted in locations where flow disturbances are minimal and/or well characterized. To this end, aerodynamic flow field calculations shall be carried out for the aircraft above applicable to a range of airspeeds and various angles of attack. 
Once optimal locations for free airstream sensors has been determined, aerodynamic loads shall be calculated for attachments, pylons and idealized shapes of the free airstream sensors. The load calculations shall be performed for a range of airspeeds and angles of attack.
If you are interested, please email the following information to PNNL by 10:00 a.m. PST, Monday, March 15, 2018:

If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov), or any other 3rd party provider, attachments may not be available or viewable to you.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Program Operations is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes for a requirement to upgrade the avionics suites currently installed in the FAAâ€™s Bombardier CL-604 aircraft to add ADS-B out V2.  The FAA is requesting a rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the cost, systems/equipment, and time necessary to accomplish the upgrade and get required approvals necessary to make this aircraft flight ready (See Attachment A).  This modification/ installation will add the FAA 2020 mandated ADS-B equipment on this aircraft and be able to meet FAA and ICAO 2020 compliant aircraft avionics ADS-B Out mandates.   
The most critical estimate is for the cost and time it will take to complete the upgrade on this aircraft, taking into consideration cost of engineering, time and cost of de-installation of old systems, taking out old wiring and installation of new cabling harness, time and cost to install the new equipment, time and cost of systems integration of the remaining old systems that are required to work with the newly installed avionics equipment/systems, and time and cost to obtain the required certifications to have the aircraft flying fully certified.

As stated above, this Market Survey is requesting information from vendors that are currently in the business of upgrading and modifying general aviation jet aircraft to meet the FAAâ€™s 2020 ADS-B Out mandate.  The information being requested at this time is for planning purposes only and for the development of a source list.  The FAA needs good cost and time estimations on what the cost will be and how much time and effort it will take to bring the FAAâ€™s Challenger 604 aircraft up to a level that they can continue to fly another 10 to 15 years and meet both FAA and ICAO avionics standards.  As a part of this Market Survey, we ask that vendorâ€™s complete and provide information on Attachment A to this survey.  The information needs to be provided as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).  This form requests information on cost of non-recurring engineering required for STC preparation and submittal for approval, time and cost of old systems/equipment removal, time and cost for installation of new equipment /Systems wiring and cabling upgraded, and time and cost to install the new avionics systems/equipment on the aircraft and meet the FAA and ICAO requirements for 2020 flights in the U.S. or anywhere in the world.  Please provide the information requested on the Attachment A to this market survey.  This information will be used in development of sources for possible sources for this installation.  Any information provided will be determined to be proprietary to each vendor if provided with proprietary markings and will only be seen by FAA personnel and will not be released.  

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest/capability and a ROM from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified firms, and all other business types and sizes, capable of providing the requirement described.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR OFFERS. A SIR/Request for Offer may be made under a separate announcement in the future. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing vendor responses to this market survey. Therefore any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendorâ€™s expense.

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (FIS) is conducting this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes to meet a requirement to upgrade the avionics suites currently installed in the FAAâ€™s three (3) Bombardier CL-601 aircraft.  The FAA is requesting a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the cost, systems/equipment, and time necessary to accomplish the upgrade and obtain approval for required Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) necessary to make these aircraft flight ready (See Attachment A).  This modification will upgrade the current avionics suite and equipment (currently a 1995 version similar to that found on the Lear Jet 60 standard avionics suite configuration) to an FAA and ICAO 2020 compliant aircraft avionics suite configuration in addition to meeting all 2020 ADS-B Out mandates and must include the following avionics systems:

  â€¢Future Air Navigation (FANS) 1/A with Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC)
  â€¢R3 Global Positioning Systems (GPS) â€“ Install Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) capable GPS
  â€¢Flight Management System (FMS) â€“ Introduction of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) AR 0.3 capability
  â€¢Weather Radar System â€“ Multi-scan Weather Radar
  â€¢ATC Transponder System â€“ Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B DO-260B) 

The FAA is open to all upgrades that provide the aircraft with the mandated 2020 avionics capabilities and requirements to enable them to fly anywhere in the world.  The FAA does prefer that a proposed upgrade is based on the ProLine 21 Avionics Suites with Advanced Avionics capability similar to that called out in Service Bulletins 605-34-019 and 605-00-003 Rev. 11; based on efficiencies from fleet standardization of aircraft systems.  The most critical estimate is for the cost and time it will take to complete the upgrade on the first aircraft, taking into consideration the following

  â€¢Cost of engineering
  â€¢Time and cost of de-installation of old systems--taking out old wiring and installation of new cabling harness
  â€¢Time and cost to install the new equipment
  â€¢Time and cost of systems integration of the remaining old systems that are required to work with the newly installed avionics equipment/systems, and
  â€¢Time and cost to obtain the required certifications and STCs to have the first aircraft flying fully certified.  

In addition to the Learjet 60 Avionics system installed on the FAAâ€™s CL-601 aircraft, the FAA has added additional modifications to the aircraft that may be impacted by the requirement to upgrade.  Some of the systems below will require the vendor to remove and replace with new updated avionics equipment/systems; new wiring; and cabling harness.  Other system listed below will stay on the aircraft but will require integration to work with the newly installed avionics equipment and systems.  A list of these supplemental modifications is shown below.  Those marked with (**) are systems that will stay on the aircraft after modification and may be required to interface with the new avionics systems to be installed:

  â€¢**Passenger Oxygen Systems -- SA5940SW thru Rev 01
  â€¢**AVIAC Horizontal Stabilizer Trim Control Systems -- ST00210WI thru Rev. B
