This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government&#39;s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

Government&#39;s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (385) 591-1672.

Requirements for Commercial Aircraft and Support Items: 




	
	Background 
	



	
	A Partner Nation (PN) previously procured five (5) AC-208 Cessna Caravans through U.S. Foreign Military Sales. The AC-208&rsquo;s were procured to provide the partner with a single, organic asset that can find, fix, and finish enemy combatants in one package. The aircraft has similar capabilities to the MQ-9 in terms of finding targets with a high-fidelity targeting pod, launching hellfire missiles at targets, and having an extended loiter time to remain on station. Current operations have shifted away from overt signatures and buildings to personnel hiding in obscure environments.  
	



	
	Upon completion of the upgrade, the PN desires the capability to gain Positive Identification (PID) of individual people with fidelity beyond 1.5 kilometers (km). Current capabilities require the aircrew to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; the target by flying directly overhead. After flying overhead to gain PID (inside the AGM-114 Hellfire minimum launch range), the aircraft must execute a turn away from the target to build enough range for an attack run-in within the hellfire weapons employment zone, at which point the target is no longer visible. This was verified by a senior U.S. pilot (with over 2,000 hours of experience as an evaluator/instructor in fighter and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft) flying onboard the AC-208. Recent missions highlight the PN&rsquo;s desire to use the AC-208 as their primary strike platform, but it is only successfully utilized on targets that can be acquired beyond three nautical miles (e.g. 04APR25 VBIED strike). 
	







	
	Details of the Request 
	



	
	The PN requests procurement, integration and installation of the following components onto each of their five (5) AC-208 Combat Caravan light-attack, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) aircraft: 
	



	
	Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) airborne surveillance and reconnaissance turret  
	



	
	Multiple Processing Units (MPU) 
	



	
	Video Switch Matrix Units 
	



	
	7&rdquo; Flip Up Display Monitors 
	



	
	Technical Manuals Updates 
	



	
	Familiarization/Differences Training on Component Upgrades:  
	



	
	2-week training program for 10 individuals, focused on new features and functionalities by the hardware upgrades. The underlying software and system functionality will remain unchanged.  
	



	
	Operational Framework 
	



	
	An assessment of current fleet configuration.     
	



	
	An airworthiness Type Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the equipment being installed. The approval from the FAA is required prior to the installation.  
	



	
	Installation and integration of components onto the aircraft must be performed at the customer&rsquo;s Main Operating Base (MOB) in an austere location. 
	



	
	Customer requires that 80% of the operational fleet (4/5 aircraft) must always be available for operations, so installation must be done sequentially

The ultimate awardee of the proposed contract action must be an authorized repair source. Award of the proposed contract action will not be delayed while an unauthorized source seeks to obtain authorization.G.  The Government is requesting a Repair Turnaround Time (RTAT) of: 142 days after receipt of asset.Repair Turnaround Time (RTAT) definition: The resultant contractual delivery requirement is measured from asset Return to the date of asset acceptance under the terms of the contract.  For purposes of this section, Return is defined as physical receipt of theF-condition asset at the contractor's facility as reflected in the Action Date entry in the Commercial Asset Visibility (CAV) system.  In accordance with the CAV Statement of Work, the contractor is required to accurately report all transactions by the end of thefifth regular business day after receipt and the Action Date entered in CAV must be dated to reflect the actual date of physical receipt.  The Contractor must obtain final inspection and acceptance by the Government for all assets within the RTATs established inthis contract.Please note freight is handled by Navy CAV or Proxy CAV as stated in NAVSUPWSSFA24 or NAVSUPWSSFA25.Throughput Constraint: Contractor must provide a throughput Constraint for each NSN(s).  Total assets to be repaired monthly after initial delivery commences: _____/month (contractor is to fill in #).  A throughput of ?0? (zero) per month reflects no throughputconstraint.Induction Expiration Date: 365 days after contract award date. Any asset received after this date in days is not authorized for repair without bi-lateral agreement between the Contractor and NAVSUP WSS Contracting Officer.H.  IMPORTANT NOTE:Reconciliation Price Reduction:Any asset(s) for which the contractor does not meet the required RTAT will incur a price reduction per unit/per month the contractor is late.  However, any delay determined to be excusable (e.g. Government Delay) will not result in a price reduction.  If thecontractor does not meet the required RTAT due to inexcusable contractor delay, the Contracting Officer will implement the aforementioned price reduction via a ""Reconciliation Modification"" at the end of the contract performance.  Price reductions made pursuant to this section shall not limit other remedies available to the Government for failure to meet required RTATs, including but not limited to the Government's right to terminate for default.In reference to the above important note, the contractor provides the following price reduction amount per unit/per month the contractor does not meet the RTAT: $___________, up to a maximum of: $__________.

Issue Date: 8 August 2025 &ndash; Closing Date:  25 August 2025&ndash; 4:00 PM EDT

Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) is seeking information for market research purposes regarding capabilities to provide supplies and/or services in support of the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS) Low Band Transmitter Antenna Group (LBT-AG), ALQ-99 TJS Low Band Consolidated Antenna Group (LBC-AG), ALQ-99 TJS Band 9/10 Transmitter, Next Generation Jammer &ndash; Lowband (NGJ-LB) Amplifiers, P-8A Poseidon Aircraft ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) Scanner Antenna Unit (SAU), P-8A Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Modified Scanner Antenna Unit (MSAU), ALQ-240 ESM Select Components, and Select Components utilized in the EA-18G Growler Aircraft Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Suite. These electronic warfare systems are installed on the US Navy EA-18G Growler aircraft, P-8A Poseidon aircraft and other EW platforms. Anticipated supplies include but are not limited to: Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRAS), Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAS), sub-SRAS, bit/piece parts, test equipment, and ancillary equipment. Anticipated services include but are not limited to: Engineering and technical support, redesigns, product improvements, upgrades, system and subsystem integration, engineering analyses, documentation (e.g. drawings, data, and software), and repair.

This effort is anticipated to be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 10 U.S.C. &sect; 3204(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NSWC Crane intends to award a Basic Ordering Agreement on a sole source basis to CAES Systems LLC. The basis for restricting competition is because either the Government does not possess the technical data packages or data rights for the above listed subsystems or the duplication of cost/schedule to test another vendor&rsquo;s system for flight use is cost/time prohibitive. CAES Systems LLC is the only contractor possessing the capability to provide the required supplies/services to meet mission requirements without significant duplicative costs and time delays to the Government, which would not be recouped through a competitive contract action.

In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities to enable them to meet the Government&rsquo;s requirements may respond.  Responses shall address technical capabilities to provide the support described herein for each subsystem. All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than five (5) pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, and an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the estimates of duplication of costs and time delays.

Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:

Submitter&rsquo;s Name

Street Address, City, State, Zip Code

Business Size

Point of Contact (POC)

POC Telephone

Announcement Number:  N0016425SNB85

Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.

Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.

At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.

Market Survey information may be submitted to the Point of Contact (POC) any time prior to the expiration of this announcement.

Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.3.4.1   NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG - Manufacture of this item requires vendor certification in accordance with NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG.3.4.2    ;Submarine outboard cable assembly that must be in compliance with molding manual NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Design, Manufacture, and Performance - Except as modified herein, the TUBE,COMMUNICATION furnished under this contract/purchase order shall meet the design, manufacture, and performance requirements specified on drawing ;10001 2526778; cage ; . 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled &quot;Configuration Management&quot;, Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved.

Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor&#39;s request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a &quot;Warning Plate&quot; stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor&#39;s overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5. PACKAGING 5.1 Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking - Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking shall be in accordance with the Contract/Purchase Order Schedule and as specified below.

3feed9f14d404580b4f5ce0a502a97a7,AMDTCNOI2502035,Ouster OS2-128 Channel LiDAR,"Introduction
This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation.  A solicitation document will not be issued, and quotations will not be requested.  

Purpose
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed priced purchase order on a brand name only basis with authorized resellers of Ouster, Inc. The purchase order will specifically procure an Ouster OS2-128 Channel LiDAR. Delivery is required within 5 weeks after contractor receipt of order.



Authority
This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of FAR Subpart 11.105 allowing the Contracting Officer (CO) to solicit items peculiar to one manufacturer. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with the small business size standard of 1,350 Employees. 


Description
The NIST Intelligent Systems Division&#39;s (ISD) mission is to advance measurement science for sensing and perception systems, particularly for Automated Vehicle (AV) safety and performance. ISD uses LiDAR for precise object detection and distance measurement for sensor fusion tasks which is crucial for improving AV perception performance. Existing LiDAR resources are insufficient for current ISD research needs resulting in a requirement a new LiDAR resource.



Sole Source Determination
The sole source determination is based on the following:



NIST currently owns and operates an Ouster OS1-32 LiDAR for research purposes. A 128-channel LiDAR is now required for NIST efforts and the new system must interoperate with the existing Ouster system. NIST&rsquo;s research projects which will use the new system were design around the Ouster ROS framework, driver package, and Autoware stack. Other brands of LiDAR will not work with the existing setup which includes a custom rack design around use of Ouster LiDAR technology. Only the Ouster OS2-128 LiDAR is capable of meeting NIST needs. Ouster authorizers resellers; however none of the resellers are small businesses. Therefore, to ensure compatibility with existing research apparatuses, a brand name only competition amongst Ouster authorized resellers is the only appropriate acquisition strategy.



Information for Interested Parties
Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing by or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation.

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Collin Randall, Contract Specialist, at Collin.Randall@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted via email to Collin.Randall@nist.gov so that they are received no later than August 13, 2025, at 10:00 AM, Eastern Time.

959f85f697af4e0a9245c7132aff3782,N00421-25-WPM202-RFI-NACES-SKU-10,RFI FOR STATE OF THE ART SURVIVAL ITEMS SUITABLE FOR CONTAINMENT IN THE SKU-10 SEAT KIT ASSEMBLY ON TACTICAL AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH THE NAVAL AVIATION COMMON EJECTION SEAT (NACES),"To promote early exchanges of information with Industry in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.2, Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Systems (NAVAIR PMA202) of Patuxent River, Maryland is issuing this Request for Information (RFI).  NAVAIR is requesting information to identify qualified sources to provide commercially available survival items for Navy and Marine Corps aircrew flying in F/A-18 and EA-18 aircraft.  The requirements for these items are provided below.  Interested parties are invited to describe their capabilities to provide the product as described herein. The Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated for the capability to meet the desired performance requirements listed below and the table listing key system attributes. 

A twofold focus exists for this effort.  First, identify a water source that will extend survival in a maritime environment (single person life raft) with a threshold of 7 days and an objective of 14 days.  For each 24-hour period, a minimum of 64 ounces of water should be produced and able to be stored within the confines of a single person life raft.  The form factor has a threshold of being able to be packed in the SKU-10 survival seat kit in a space 6 inches by 14 by 4 inches (336 square inches overall).  It cannot exceed 2 pounds.  It must have a shelf life of no less than two (2) years.  Additionally, energy sources will be Key System Attributes and can be accommodated by the aircrew in pockets on their flight gear.  Total weight cannot exceed five (5) pounds.  Pocket size is defined as 6.5 inches in width by 8 inches in length and 1 inch depth. Any pockets must securely close with a zipper or similar closure system to prevent items from falling out and creating foreign object damage to the aircraft.  Resistance to saltwater intrusion is a required characteristic. 

The Navy plans to approve COTS items that meet user requirements for local procurement by squadrons as required for mission needs.  Cost will be a consideration in determining COTS items approved for use. A cost benefit discussion regarding adding these item(s) to the federal supply system will occur.  Multiple items could be approved if found to be acceptable.

Interested parties are invited to describe their capabilities as well as provide samples as described herein.  In response to this RFI, please provide specification sheets showing the &ldquo;designed to&rdquo; standards.  Please limit your RFI responses 5 pages.  The product sample as well as product information shall be submitted at no expense to the Government.  The samples and corresponding information will not be returned.  It is also requested that pricing be included with the submitted product and information.   Proprietary data MUST be marked on a page-by-page basis, and will be kept confidential and protected in accordance with the Uniform Trades Secret Act. 

Key System Attributes, Thresholds, and Test Methods

Key System Attribute 1: Water production should be through a process of osmosis. With a focus on energy exerted and perspiration by the aircrew, forward osmosis is a preferred solution. A hydration gel could be evaluated but must fit the form factor. All proposed solutions must fit the form factor noted above with a shelf life of not less than 2 years.

Key System Attribute 1 Threshold: A minimum of 7 days of capability must exist. Must be compatible with available space in the SKU-10 seat kit assembly.

Key System Attribute 1 Test Method: Demonstration/user evaluation; analysis of provided specification



Key System Attribute 2: A food or energy source should provide at least 2,000 calories per day and meet the form factor noted above.  It must have a shelf life of not less than 2 years.

Key System Attribute 2 Threshold: A minimum of 2000 calories per serving with a sufficient number of servings to address a survival scenario of 7 days.

Key System Attribute 2 Test Method: Analysis; user evaluation



Key System Attribute 3: Both water and food/energy packaging must be waterproof and not impacted by exposure to salt water.

Key System Attribute 3 Threshold: Impervious to saltwater intrusion. 

Key System Attribute 3 Test Method: User evaluation; lab quantification of percent salt intrusion.

The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973,Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D.  Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E.  Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E.  (Originaland two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa.  17055-0788.)3.3.1   Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders untilanother drawing revision is approved.  The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted,the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority.        Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below.        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in thespecification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements.4.2   Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government.  The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001.4.2.1    ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements toMIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.;4.3   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of anyinspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformancedoes not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.4.4   Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders)  Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government duringthe performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies.5.

Cage _______ ref. no.                     ;10001       1559957;3.2   Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordancewith ;MIL-STD-129; .3.3   Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated.  The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973,Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D.  Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E.  Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E.  (Originaland two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa.  17055-0788.)3.3.1   Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders untilanother drawing revision is approved.  The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted,the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority.        Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below.        The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788.        Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor.3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the materialwill be cause for rejection.       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  Thecontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement ContractingOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes ofcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they arelocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in apolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as therequirements of this contract are concerned.       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in acomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surfaceship atmosphere.4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in thespecification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements.4.2   Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government.  The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001.4.2.1    ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements toMIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.;4.3   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.  The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program.  The absence of anyinspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformancedoes not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.4.4   Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders)  Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government duringthe performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies.5.  PACKAGING5.1   Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking - Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking shall be in accordance with the Contract/Purchase Order Schedule and as specified below.MIL-STD 2073 PACKAGING APPLIES AS FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THE SCHEDULE6.

0f89aff9159947179ca1b9d260b7c823,N6660420DQ000,N66604-20-D-Q000 SubHDR Repair Contract,"The following notice serves as a request for information (RFI) prepared in accordance with DFARS PGI 206.302-1 and a proposed contract action synopsis prepared in accordance with FAR 5.2 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

This is a synopsis/RFI for an Ordering Period extension modification to Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 awarded on a sole source basis to Raytheon Company (hereafter referred to as &quot;RTX&quot;) on 24 September 2020.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 is 334511; the size standard is 1,350 employees.

Contract Number N66604-20-D-Q000 is for Testing, Inspection and Evaluation (TI&amp;E), maintenance, repair, upgrade, and restoration or replacement of SubHDR Mast Antenna Lowest Repairable Units (LRUs).

The purpose of the proposed modification is to extend the ordering period from 23 September 2025 to 23 September 2027. This is necessary in order to utilize the remaining ceiling and prevent a gap in services while a follow-on contract is established. The scope of the types of services and supplies and the contract ceiling will remain unchanged. 

For this proposed contract action, the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. As established in Justification &amp; Approval number 17030.1, approved prior to the award of N66604-20-D-Q000, RTX is the only responsible source that has completed functional, performance, and environmental qualifications of the SubHDR MG LRUs and subcomponents.  Due to the complex nature of the SubHDR MG, the environmentally challenging underwater outboard use, and the rigorous certification criteria for SubHDR MGs, LRUs and subcomponents, RTX is the only source that currently possesses the knowledge and expertise required to perform the TI&amp;Es and RUORs.  This ordering period extension modification is required in order to allow for the continued performance of the TI&amp;Es and RUORs. Failure to do so will result in a gap in contractual coverage that will jeopardize continuity of services, program stability, and mission readiness. Additionally, it would also result in unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The place of performance is at the Contractor&rsquo;s site, Marlborough, MA.

The modification is expected to be awarded on or around 23 September 2025.

The synopsis/RFI is not a request for competitive proposals. This requirement is being posted to maximize communication with industry. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not delay award for consideration of capability statements submitted.

Information shall be submitted prior to 13 August 2025 via email to ALL of the following points of contact:

COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS - THESE SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES. THEY MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLISHERS OR SOCIETIES OF THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS.6.2   Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation ofabbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423.Block A:  Is the actual contract line item no.Block B:  Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s)          which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase          order.Block C:  Is the category of data required, TDP is defined          in MIL-T-31000.  TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B          of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's          included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as          NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals          without purchasing hardware and related TDP software.  Therefore,          most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP.Block D:  Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item          being purchased.Block E:  Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number,          invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and          monitoring purposes.Block F:  Is the successful offerors name and or cage code.Block G:  Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the          individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the          requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP).Block H:  Self explanatory.Block I:  Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content          and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP.Block J:  Self explanatory.Block 1:  Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN).Block 2:  Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4.Block 3:  Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if          the title requires clarification.Block 4:  Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual          Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number.  In the event          the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered          TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order.Block 5:  Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement          statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found.Block 6:  Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval,          conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item.Block 7:  Is a code which designates authority for inspection and          acceptance of the deliverable item.  The definition of the          codes is as follows:              DD Form 250 Code    Inspection    Acceptance                    SS               (1)           (2)                    DD               (3)           (4)                    SD               (1)           (4)                    DS               (3)           (5)                    LT               (6)           (7)                    NO               (8)           (8)                    XX               (9)           (9)          (1)  Inspection at source.          (2)  Acceptance at source.          (3)  No inspection performed at source.

The data is sent by the               contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14               of the DD Form 1423.  LT is used when the contracting               agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each               and every piece of data developed by the contractor.               The only other authorized use of LT is the special               case where the contracting agency does not desire to               have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a               Government quality assurance representative perform               inspection.  The Government quality assurance               representative shall be listed on the distribution               in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via               the quality assurance letter of inspection.               Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising               final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical               Manuals.  (LT may, however, be used for delivery of               preliminary TDP's or TM's).          (7)  As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423.          (8)  No inspection or acceptance required.  No DD Form 250 or               letter of transmittal required.               Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising               Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals.          (9)  Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere               in the contract.Block 8:  Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring          specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of          the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A""          in this field.  This data item requires submission of a          preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document.          When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD          Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government          approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the          contractor to resubmit the data after Government          approval/disapproval has been issued.  Block 16 will also          indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g.,          approval of technical content and/or format.Block 9:  Is the distribution statement code which explains how the          Government can circulate the deliverable item.  The definition          of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows:          A.  Distribution of the item is unrestricted.          B.  Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only.          C.  Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with              a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the              DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek,              Mich. or Government activities.          D.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities              and DOD contractors only.          E.  Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components              only.          F.  Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign              Nations and Foreign Nationals.Block 10:  Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to           be delivered to the Government.  The abbreviations and           their meaning.              ANNLY                  Annually              ASGEN                  As generated              ASREQ                  As required              BI-MO                  Every two months              BI-WE                  Every two weeks              DAILY                  Daily              DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery              MTHLY                  Monthly              ONE/R                  One time with revisions              QRTLY                  Quarterly              SEMIA                  Every six months              WEKLY                  Weekly              XTIME                  Number of times to be submitted                                     (1time, 2times...9times)           Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16          to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately          price the deliverable data item.          Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on          occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423.  When other          abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16          of the DD Form 1423.Block 11:  Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day           format, the deliverable item is to be received by the           requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423           for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single           delivery.  If the item is to be submitted multiple           times, the number stated is the number of calendar days           after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be           received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the           DD Form 1423.  On occasion the deliverable item will be           required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency           cited in Block 6.  In that event the requirement will be           fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423.Block 12:  Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to           the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in           year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their           meaning are as follows:              ASGEN                  As generated              ASREQ                  As required              DAC                    Days after contract date              DFDEL                  Deferred Delivery              EOC                    End of contract              EOM                    End of month              EOQ                    End of quarter       Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in       Block 16.  If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific       event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16       of the DD Form 1423.  ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred       Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16.Block 13:  Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after           the initial submission.  Subsequent submission is only used to           indicate the specific time period. The data is required when           Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is           required.  This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable           item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined           to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable.Block 14a:  Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to            be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full            name, address (including code) will be specified.  That specific            information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423.Block 14b:  Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to            be submitted.  When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted            Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required.            (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.)Block 15:  Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required           by Block 14.Block 16:  Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information           Blocks 1 through 15.  This block is also the only area used to           tailor the document listed in Block 4.  Only deletions to the           minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are           allowed.  Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for           delivery of the data.Block 17:  Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the           appropriate price group.  The price groups are defined as follows:           A.  Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the                Government's requirements.  The contractor does not need this               type of data to perform the rest of the contract.  Price               would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General               and Administrative (G&A) and profit.           B.  Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be               reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements.               The price for data in this group would be based on the direct               cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and               to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit.           C.  Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own               use and which requires no substantial change to conform to               Government requirements regarding depth of content, format,               frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data.  Only               the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead,               G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group.           D.  Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part               of his commercial business.  Not much of this data is required               and the cost is insignificant.  The item should normally               be coded ""no charge.""  An example is a brochure or brief manual               developed for commercial application which will be acquired               in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify               the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go               with the acquisition.Block 18:  Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total           price which is estimated to be attributable to the production           or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA.

3a6675cb0ef1482aaea64dbdb6eaf2f8,OS2025S3K0051,NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT,"NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT

****THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS***

Requisition No: OS2025S3K0051

Intended Source: MITRE Corporation

Period of performance: 2-years

NAICS Codes:

&bull; 541330: Engineering Services  

Please note: This Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source contract was originally posted on SAM.GOV on or about March 20, 2025, as a 5-year effort.  The Notice of Intent was narrowed down to a 2-year effort instead.

Description of Requirement:

The Department of Transportation, Office of the Secretary intends to award a sole-source Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract award, solicit, and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1).

The intended CPFF contract will be a follow-on for 2-years and is for Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support services operated by The MITRE Corporation (MITRE). This is a new contract based on the current contract, which has a period of performance of August 1, 2025, to July 31, 2027.  The contract is between MITRE and the Department of Transportation, Office of Aviation Analysis (OAA). 

In 1990, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identified and formalized a need for a long-term relationship with an independent research and development entity that would provide essential research and engineering capabilities to support the FAA&#39;s mission. Based on this need, the FAA established an FFRDC. In partnership with the FFRDC, the FAA seeks to provide a safe, secure, and efficient global aviation system that contributes to the national economy, productivity, security, and the promotion of United States aviation interests. The FAA selected MITRE to operate the FFRDC designated as the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD).

In accordance with the definition of a FFRDC described in Part 35.017 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, an FFRDC is uniquely positioned to be able to provide support and guidance in an environment aligned with the needs of the OAA organization and free of competitive pressures because an FFRDC neither competes with private industry nor manufactures hardware products or software. The goal of this contract structure is to provide a contract vehicle that permits objective and independent support, eliminates the administrative costs of annual negotiations, and fosters the required program continuity.

Description of Supplies/Services: In the course of MITRE&rsquo;s long-term relationship with the FAA, MITRE has developed expertise in areas corresponding to the needs of OAA. The FAA Sponsoring Agreement for the operation of CAASD states that CAASD&rsquo;s role includes performance analysis and assessment of national airspace operations and conducting economic, environmental, and policy analysis of impacts on the national airspace system, operators, users, other stakeholders, and the Nation.

Through the proposed contract, the Government will obtain access to CAASD capabilities of specific interest to OAA, including analysis of: (1) Domestic and international aviation industry/markets; (2) Air carrier performance and practices; (3) Regulatory analysis; (4) Cost-benefit analysis; (5) Aviation policy analysis; (6) International trade; (7) Development and application of economic models; (8) Advanced econometrics and discrete choice modeling; (9) Consumer impacts; (10) Computable general equilibrium modeling; (11) Statistical analysis; and (12) Aviation forecasting.

Authority Cited: This action is authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) as implemented by FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), which states that &ldquo;full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award a contract to a particular source in order to&hellip;.establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other non-profit institution or a federally funded research and development center.&rdquo;

Demonstration that the Contractor&rsquo;s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the use of the Authority Cited Above (Applicability of Authority): An FFRDC executes activities that are sponsored under a broad charter by a Government agency for the purpose of performing, analyzing, integrating, supporting, and/or managing basic or applied research and/or development. This contract will be issued pursuant to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Sponsoring Agreement for the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), the FAA&rsquo;s FFRDC.

The role and use of FFRDCs are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (48 CFR 35.017). Specifically, the regulations state that FFRDCs:

&bull;           Exist to meet some special long-term research or development need which cannot be met as effectively by existing in-house or contractor resources.

&bull;           Enable agencies to use private sector resources to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of the sponsoring agency.

&bull;           Have access, beyond that common to normal contractors, to Government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, employees, equipment, and facilities.

&bull;           Must conduct their business in a manner befitting their special relationship with the Government, to operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts, and to have full disclosure of their affairs to the sponsoring agency.

&bull;           Are not intended to use their privileged information or access to compete with the private sector.

Furthermore, an FFRDC is uniquely enabled by the Government to perform work &ldquo;closely associated with inherently governmental functions&rdquo; as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Letter 11-01, Performance of Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions (76 Fed Reg 56227).

In addition, while no requirement exists to obtain competition for the reasons cited in paragraph 4, FAR 35.017-4(a) provides that in reviewing FFRDCs &ldquo;the sponsor, prior to extending the contract or agreement with an FFRDC, shall conduct a Comprehensive Review of the use and need for the FFRDC.&rdquo; The FAA, the sponsoring agent for the CAASD FFRDC, conducted a comprehensive review in FY2020. This review determined that there remains a requirement for an FFRDC and included consideration of alternative sources to meet the sponsor&rsquo;s needs. No additional review is required by the Department of Transportation at this time; the FAA Comprehensive Review has already satisfied this FAR requirement.  Awarding to a company other than MITRE who has already established relationship and proprietary information will cause a delay in services.

DOT will solicit and continue to negotiate directly with MITRE Corporation and no solicitation will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. Offerors must have an active registration in SAM.GOV (SAM) www.sam.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties must express their interest and must be submitted in writing via email to Melinda Riddick at Melinda.Riddick@dot.gov by 12:00 PM, Friday, August 1, 2025 and cc Robin Golden at Robin.Golden@dot.gov. No faxed documents will be accepted. If no responsive statements are received by the due date, an award will be made to The MITRE Corporation.
