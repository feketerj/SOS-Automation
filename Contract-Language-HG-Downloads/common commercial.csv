47df6dee6d8c5a699ffd73d091d9e6a0-re,RFQ1768565,DHS  USCG  Parametric Ship Hull Modeling in Rhino,"The General Services Administration (GSA), on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is conducting market research to identify potential contractors capable of providing specialized engineering technical support services. The primary goal is to enhance the capabilities of the Salvage Engineering Response Team (SERT), a unit within the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) that provides critical naval architecture support during marine casualties. SERT's mission involves creating computerized ship hull models to evaluate stability and structural integrity using limited information available during such emergencies.

The work being requested involves developing a parametric hull model creation tool using Rhinoceros, a 3D computer-aided design software widely used for its robust modeling capabilities. This tool aims to streamline the process of generating accurate ship models by leveraging Rhinoceros' built-in functionalities, including its Python script editor and Grasshopper algorithm editor. The contractor will be tasked with automating a rapid hull design and fairing methodology, enabling SERT to quickly produce reliable models from basic ship drawings and dimensions during time-sensitive salvage operations.

The scope of this task order includes developing, testing, and documenting this modeling tool without relying on third-party plug-ins unless they are pre-approved by the USCG. The contractor will be required to produce models for common commercial ship types, validate these models against actual hydrostatic properties, and document the entire process in a technical paper detailing methodologies, assumptions, and limitations. This initiative will significantly enhance SERT's response time and accuracy in evaluating marine casualties by providing a robust tool for generating parametric hull models with minimal user intervention.

In executing this contract on a Time and Materials basis, the selected contractor will follow specific tasks outlined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). These tasks include developing sample hulls using simplified methodologies within Rhinoceros, validating their characteristics against international guidelines for stability instruments, and building an intuitive user interface for inputting essential ship data. By fulfilling these requirements, the contractor will play a pivotal role in strengthening USCG's operational readiness during maritime emergencies.",Federal Acquisition Service,2025-07-15 00:00:00+00:00,2025-07-15,2025-07-25 17:00:00+00:00,2025-07-25,,Sources Sought,,541330,Engineering Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEDERAL ACQUISITION SERVICE,,Boston,MA,02222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47df6dee6d8c5a699ffd73d091d9e6a0-re,,,,,https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/r-RFQ1768565-re,https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/ebuy/seller/prepare-quote/RFQ1768565?contractNumber=
