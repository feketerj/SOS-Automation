***THE SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED ON THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION&#39;S (NOAA) REQUIREMENT THAT ROCKWELL COLLINS INC IS THE SOLE OWNER, DEVELOPER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF THE NAVIGATIONAL FUSION DATABASE SUBSCRIPTION. ROCKWELL COLLINS DOES NOT HAVE ANY AUTHORIZED PARTNERS/RESELLERS WHO CAN PROVIDE THE FUSION DATABASE SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL.

9c9f422e913d510982cb416d3a9ad5b2-re,RFQ1734140,"DHS CPB  Engineering, Technical and Logistical Support  Market Research","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through the General Services Administration (GSA), is seeking market research responses for a project aimed at enhancing the capabilities of Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO). Under the authority granted by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, DHS is tasked with preventing terrorist attacks, reducing vulnerabilities to terrorism, and minimizing damage from such events within the United States. The AMO division plays a critical role in this mission by leveraging air and marine resources to deter, interdict, and investigate acts of terrorism and smuggling across U.S. borders.

The focus of this solicitation is on providing comprehensive engineering, technical, and logistical support for CBP's fleet of aircraft, which includes P-3 Orion aircraft acquired from the U.S. Navy as well as Bombardier DHC-8 and King Air 350ER Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft. These aircraft are vital for conducting airborne law enforcement operations that include presidential protection, investigative assistance, airspace security operations at national venues, and interdiction missions targeting drugs and contraband entering the United States. The P-3s have been specifically modified into two configurations: Airborne Early Warning (AEW) variants for surveillance purposes and Long-Range Tracker (LRT) variants for interception missions.

The scope of work outlined in this solicitation encompasses a range of technical assistance services necessary to maintain optimal performance levels across CBP's aviation assets. This includes support for radar systems, optical equipment, communication systems, training on air vehicle operations and mission equipment usage, as well as repair services. Additionally, there is a need for modification services to keep these systems up-to-date with evolving threats.

Each aircraft undergoes periodic scheduled and unscheduled maintenance that requires specific tools, parts, and test equipment. As a result, an efficient, safe, and non-damaging mode of transportation for heavy aircraft equipment is critical for maintenance operations.



(II)       This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NM-AN2200-23-01255, NAME: AOC Tire Cart



(III)      The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2023-02.



(IV)      This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,250 Employees. 



(V)       This specification contains requirements for



A dedicated aviation tire service cart, capable of bearing heavy aircraft equipment, is required to transport tire and wheel assemblies, servicing equipment, and maintenance tools from the aviation warehouse to the hangar. Agency needs include: a cart narrow enough to navigate confined spaces, a high load bearing capacity, and large enough to haul all required equipment in a single trip. A towable service cart will decrease maintenance turnaround times by providing a rapid and functional method of transportation for historically person-carried items. While multiple pieces of equipment can be hauled at a time, maintenance personnel can shift focus to actions on the aircraft instead of relocation of parts.

Throughout hurricane season, the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) advertises mission response actions within a 24 hour period, better known as alert 24. Efficient maintenance practices help to ensure that NOAA aircraft are returned to service with minimal down time. While NOAA&rsquo;s heavy aircraft will derive the greatest benefit, all T/M/S aircraft at AOC will be positively affected by the purchase of a tire service cart. As hurricane season 2023 rapidly approaches, it is recommended to prioritize this purchase for immediate use.

Requirements 

An efficient mode of transportation for aircraft tires, equipment, and tools.

8ac4565caa9b41eaa9e0284264c3fc9d,70B02C22R00000015,Multirole Enforcement Aircraft Land Interdiction (MEA LI),"Amendment Posted 08-02-2022--Attached is the SF30.

 The purpose of this amendment A0003 to RFP 70B02C22R000000015 is to (1) clarify how CBP&rsquo;s CLIN Structure under Section B shall be proposed and (2) update the Cost/Price Proposal Financial Capability submission requirement as follows:

1. Section B CLIN Structure is clarified for written proposal purposes as follows:

CLIN 0001 through CLIN 4001:   Fully Missionized MEA-LI

CLIN 0001AA Fully Missionized MEA LI Prototype.  This is the first aircraft to be delivered.  Offerors shall price a fully missionized (airframe, LI sensor system, consoles, displays, cameras, and various communication systems) aircraft meeting all requirements in the SOW and corresponding Performance Specification.  All other orders under CLIN X001 will follow after the prototype.

CLIN 0002 through CLIN 4002 MEA-LI Non-Radar Equipped: Offerors shall price this CLIN the same as CLIN X001 above exclusive of any radars equipped with the aircraft.

CLIN 0003 through CLIN 4003 Green Aircraft.  Offerors shall price this CLIN for the aircraft only.

CLIN 0004 through CLIN 4004 Mission System Integration:  Offerors shall price the installation of the mission system.  This CLIN purchase would only occur if the Government doesn&rsquo;t receive full funding for a CLIN X001 Fully Missionized MEA-LI.  An example would be whereas the CBP orders a Green Aircraft (CLIN X003) and Long Lead Items (X005) due to limited funds.  When more funding is available, CBP may order the Mission Systems Integration (CLIN X004) to missionize the King Air.

CLIN 0005 through CLIN 5005/CLIN 0006 through CLIN 5006:  Long Lead Item Package.  These CLINs are deemed necessary based on CBP&rsquo;s assumption that potential long lead items could be the EO/IR camera or the Radar.  These are examples only and not a complete list.  Offerors are reminded that within 30 days after the Critical Design Review (CDR), the Contractor shall provide a Recommended Spare Parts List (RSPL) and recommended support equipment that will be required to operate and maintain each aircraft. (Reference SOW Para C.10)

2.  Under Volume II-Cost/Price Proposal, revise Section 3-Financial Capability to read as follows:

Section 3 - Financial Capability

The offeror shall provide the following data for itself and for any subcontractors for which the total value of the subcontract is greater than $2,000,000.00 (inclusive of base and option years):


	Provide a copy of annual financial statements including certified balance sheet, profit/loss statement and statement of retained earnings covering each of the offeror&#39;s last three annual accounting periods, including the most recent partial period, if currently available.
	Specify the financial capacity, working capital and other financial resources available to perform the contract.

Original RFP Posting: 

The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is issuing this Request for Proposal (RFP) to establish a Single Award IDIQ with Firm Fixed Price and Time and Material (T&amp;M) line items.  This RFP is to procure up to nine (9) Multirole Enforcement Aircraft along with associated spares and services.



This procurement action is being solicited as Other than Full and Open Competition through SAM.gov. The airframe (Textron Aviation, Inc. King Air B300 model) is a brand name requirement and is the only exclusion from full and open competition.  All other requirements within this RFP are full and open.  The Acquisition Title is &ldquo;Multirole Enforcement Aircraft Land Interdiction (MEA LI)&rdquo;.   



The principle nature of the requirements described in this solicitation is consistent with supplies provided by industries in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 336411 &ldquo;Aircraft Manufacturing&rdquo; with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.



CBP invites your company to participate in phase 1 (Oral Presentations) and provide written portions after the advisory notifications are provided for phase 2 (written submission) to submit a technical and separate full pricing proposal for the efforts described in this RFP including the terms and conditions, the Statement of Work and all other attachments. CBP will select for award the most responsible Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those evaluation criteria offering the best value to the Government using the trade-off process. &ldquo;Best value&rdquo; is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis among price and non-price factors. The basis for the award will be a detailed, integrated evaluation by the Government on the basis of how well the proposal achieves solicitation requirements and satisfies the evaluation criteria specified herein. Accordingly, the Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the offeror with the highest technical merit rating. In making this comparison, the Government is concerned with overall merit of the capability of the following evaluation factors: Factor 1 &ldquo;Radar Solution and Integration Capabilities&rdquo; is most important.  Factor 2 &ldquo;Technical and Management Capability&rdquo; is less important than Factor 1.  Oral Presentations (Factor 1) and Technical and Management Capability (Factor 2), when combined, are significantly more important than Price (Factor 3).  Factor 3 &ldquo;Price&rdquo; is the least important factor. The importance of Factor 3 will increase if Offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of Factors 1 and 2 or if a price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal&rsquo;s technical superiority to the Government. Within Factor 1, Elements 1 through 3 are considered to be of equal importance. Within Factor 2 Elements 1 through 4 are in descending order of importance. The elements are not subfactors and will not be individually rated but will be evaluated as a whole to arrive at the factor-level rating. Note:  The elements for Factors 1 and 2 are provided in the RFP Provisions section.



The Government may make award without discussions with Offeror (except communications conducted for the purposes of minor clarification); hence your offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offering firm is able to submit to the Government. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if they are later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.



RFP QUESTIONS DUE July 8, 2022 at 3:00 pm est:

Questions or concerns regarding any aspect of this RFP must be forwarded to Michael Hall (Michael.A.Hall@cbp.dhs.gov) via email on or before 3:00PM local Washington, DC time on July 8, 2022 so that they can be addressed prior to submission of your proposal. Responses to questions will be provided via Amendment to RFP and posted to www.SAM.gov. Offerors are strongly encouraged to ask questions and convey their exceptions to the requirements during this time. The Government desires to alleviate concerns during the solicitation phase to prevent assumptions or exceptions within the proposals.

f479b7fa682549d18c6d899b74a9b38e,NM-AN0000-22-01067,"Engineering Analysis Services and RVSM Recertification for NOAA's King Air N68RF at the Aircraft Operations Center in Lakeland, FL","The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with AeroMech Inc. located in Everett, WA, a purchase order for NOAA&#39;s King Air N68RF Engineering Analysis and Recertification in Lakeland, FL.

The Government intends to utilize the authority under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will statisfy agency requirements, unless, as a result of this announcement,
acceptable responses to this notice are received and a determination is made by the Government to issue a competitive solicitation. The Government intends to award a purchase order to AeroMech Inc. in Everett, WA.

Sole Source Justification:

AeroMech, Inc. is the only Organization Designation Authority (ODA) in the world with Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) approval authority, determined by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorization in 2009. By seeking another vendor, the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center would not be able to obtain this required FAA Certification for our operations. Operations would be negatively impacted, with the potential for Aircraft on the Ground (AOG) status for N68RF.

This recertification is necessary due to unplanned removal of existing bubble windows which nullify the existing RVSM certification. As stated above, there is currently no other source in existence that can certify this plane under RVSM. This has been the case since 2009, and no other sources of RVSM certification authority have existed since then. This would result in a delay of unknown proportion, on an aircraft that is relied on for crucial data and emergency response missions across the country.

This special notice is not a request for competitive offerors and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide this service may submit substantiating documentation in writing within fifteen business days of this notice. Responses can be sent via e-mail to Abigail.green@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. If no documentation is received, award will be made directly to AeroMech Inc.

DOC, Eastern Region Acquisition Division requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made to a company not registered in SAM. Contractors active in SAM have a
unique entity identifier (UEI) that is used to do business with the federal government. The Government has moved to a free new, non-proprietary identifier that will have to be requested in, and assigned by, the System for Award Management (SAM.gov).

NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) CONTRACT LANGUAGE

NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)


	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:



	
	
		Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.
	
	



	
	
		Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.
	
	



	
	
		Identify constraints in transparency and process.
	
	



	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.



	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer&#39;s decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.



	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman&#39;s authority, for instance:



	
	
		Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.
	
	


                       The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.


	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.
	
	



	
	
		The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA&#39;s agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).
	
	



	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.



	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.



	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.

DISCLAIMER

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The contractor shall modify the avionics for six (6) Beechcraft King Air 1900C Aircraft. These aircraft have had post-production modifications installed which must be preserved in the avionics modification. These post-production modifications include the AeroData Flight Inspection System (AFIS-113) and the Lica Electro Optical System (ADS-80).

2. ELIGIBILITY: All responses shall address the following:

a. Business Size per NAICS 336413 and Classification Code 1680.

b. Identify POC including phone and email address.

c. Identify if your firm will provide Aircraft Components, Spares, and Accessories for a King Air 1900C Aircraft.

d. Provided documentation supporting the General Requirements as outlined in this announcement.

e. Delivery Date after contract award.

f. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate which shall assume the EAF will deliver the aircraft to the location in Europe where the modification shall take place and take delivery of the aircraft at the same location.

g. Provide name of Integrator at European location, if not your company.

3. REQUIRED CAPABILITIES: The information described below will also be required to fulfill this procurement.

a. The supplier must replace existing avionics with avionics which will allow the Egyptian Air Force (EAF) to fly in civil airspace under instrument flight rules (IFR) without the need for a host country waiver due to lack of avionics capabilities required for entry into that airspace.

b. The airspace of intended EAF aircraft operations includes Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia, and overwater airspace controlled under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations.

c. These EAF aircraft will not fly above Flight Level 290 (29,000&rsquo;) so avionics equipage requirements above those altitudes need not be met.

d. Modifications shall be certified for airworthiness by either the FAA or EASA regulations.

4. NEW AVIONICS SUITE: The new avionics suite must accommodate requirements listed below which are grouped into threshold and objective categories. Threshold requirements are those which are mandated in order to fly in the desired civil airspace under IFR and must be addressed by the supplier in their response. Objective requirements are those which will make flight either more efficient or increase the effectiveness or safety of the fight crew, do not have to be met by the supplier&rsquo;s response, but may be offered if desired. After each requirement, a rationale is provided to explain what the requirement demands and explains the consequences of not having it.

4.1 Threshold Requirements:

 a. VHF Communication Radios: Very High Frequency, Amplitude Modulated (VHF-AM) communications radios in the frequency range of 118.0-136.0 MHz for communications with air traffic control (ATC). The frequency spacing for this range of operations shall be selectable between 25 kHz and 8.33 kHz spacing. Two such radios are required on every aircraft for redundancy.

Rationale: Eurocontrol now requires aircraft to communicate within Europe on ATC frequencies which are spaced 8.33 kHz from each other. This is to enable more frequencies to be available within the 118-136 MHz range. Outside of Europe, the required frequency spacing is 25 kHz.

b. HF Communications Radios: High Frequency (HF) communications radio in the frequency range of 3.0 to 30.0 MHz for communications with ATC in remote areas such as oceanic routes or routes which are beyond the range of VHF communications. Control of the HF Radio system is to be fully integrated with the display system with no standalone controller.

Rationale: Flying in remote airspace outside the range of radar and VHF communication makes air traffic control difficult. ATC needs position reports from the flight crews periodically so they can provide advisories to deconflict traffic. HF radio is one of the oldest methods for providing Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communication, though it is not as effective as satellite communications. Even aircraft with Satellite communication for ATC are required to have an HF radio as a backup.

c. Transponder with EHS and ADS-B: Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance &ndash; Broadcast (ADS-B) capable transponders capable of meeting the European Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 1207/2011 which calls out the detailed performance requirements of the data transponders are required to transmit to ATC.

Rationale: Eurocontrol now mandates aircraft to equip and utilize transponders which automatically transmit a variety of digital data derived from the aircraft avionics. This data pertains to the aircraft&rsquo;s identification, location, altitude, velocities, flight status, and intentions. Some of this data is coded only once in the transponder, some data varies with each flight depending on conditions, and some data is constantly changing. The constantly changing data must be acquired from other aircraft systems such as GPS, Air Data Computer, weight on wheels sensors and other avionics.

d. ILS with FM Immunity: Europe requires that VHF navigation systems which provide VHF Omni Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) capabilities must be designed with Frequency Modulation (FM) Immunity to protect against interference from commercial VHF FM radio stations. These systems operate in the range from 108-118 MHz with the glide slope receivers operating in the UHF band.

Rationale: Europe is a densely populated continent and the number of commercial FM radio broadcast has utilized most all of the allowable VHF FM frequency spectrum from 87.0-108 MHz. Radio stations broadcasting at the upper end of this spectrum may produce signals which would interfere with an aircraft&rsquo;s ability to properly receive an ILS localizer signal on the lower end of the VHF navigation band above 108 MHz. FM Immunity is not an enhanced or additional capability, but a means of preserving an existing ILS localizer capability in the presence of commercial FM radio signals to prevent interference.

e. GNSS Enabled with SBAS: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the American Global Positioning System (GPS) or the European Galileo System, determine the aircraft&rsquo;s position and velocity around the world to a high degree of accuracy utilizing signals broadcast from a constellation of medium earth orbit satellites. 

Rationale: Terrestrial based navigational aids, such as VOR and NDB, are rapidly being decommissioned worldwide in favor of satellite based GNSS navigation. The requirements for ADS-B transponders in Europe and the United States imposes an additional requirement for GNSS equipment to provide upgraded performance and availability which may only be possible using GNSS with Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). SBAS systems, such as WAAS in North America and EGNOS in Europe and North Africa, augment basic GNSS signals with timing corrections measured on the ground in certain regions, uplinked to Geostationary Satellites, then downlinked to aircraft in flight to cancel most of the error in GNSS calculations providing a more accurate position and velocity determination. The addition of the geostationary SBAS satellite to the constellation also provides a higher degree of availability and error alerting.

f. TCAS Version 7.1: Traffic and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) {also known in Europe as Aircraft Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS)} work with the aircraft transponder to alert the flight crew to the presence of air traffic which is close enough to pose a mid-air collision hazard. 

Rationale: Europe is the only region in the world which requires TCAS Version 7.1 standard verses Version 7.0 that is all which is required in the rest of the world. The difference between 7.1 and 7.0 is a slight difference in the Resolution Advisories (RA) which are audibly transmitted to the crew via the intercom. The Version 7.1 standard is required by European Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 1332/2011.

g. Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS): TAWS systems alert aircrews when they are flying too close to the ground in order to help prevent Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) accidents. These systems sense the aircraft altitude in relation to the surrounding terrain elevation based on the aircraft position and a database of terrain elevation. When the aircraft flies into an area of rising terrain and the difference between the aircraft&rsquo;s current altitude and the terrain elevation is below an allowable tolerance, the system issues verbal warnings to the flight crew to take corrective action. The TAWS function shall be fully integrated with avionics system to reduce total system weight.

Rationale: Aircraft which carry more than six passengers are required to be equipped with a TAWS system in the US and Europe.

h. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR):  Aircraft which carry more than 19 passengers must be equipped with a CVR and FDR. CVR and FDR must be housed in a crash survivable housing and they may be combined into a single unit. For overwater flights, the CVR and/or FDR must also be equipped with and underwater locator beacon (ULB) which is capable of transmitting for 90 days after a water crash.

Rationale: A CVR and FDR are required to record the flight crew&rsquo;s voice and pertinent airplane data to aid in post-crash accident investigations.

i. ARC-210 Multiband Radio: Two of the six aircraft already have two ARC-210 radios installed and the EAF would like the other four aircraft equipped with similar capability. The model of ARC-210 installed, 629F-12A, are export variants.

Rationale: Customer requested.

j. Stormscope: Some aircraft are equipped with WX 500 stormscope. Avionics system will be capable of displaying as required stormscope data.

Rationale: Aircraft that currently have this capability utilize this to augment active weather radar information for increased convective activity situational awareness.

k. Cursor Control Device: The avionics system shall utilize a cursor control device for display management and data entry.

Rationale: Much of the flight environment and envelope is conduct in unstable and turbulent air. Data entry must be reliable and consistent to maintain low flight crew work load. A cursor control device allows a solid anchor point for entry of data by flight crew

4.2 Objective Requirements:

a. New Autopilot: The autopilot on these aircraft is old and may be in danger of component obsolescence.

Rationale: While there is no requirement for autopilot imposed by civil aviation authorities outside of RVSM airspace, autopilots are a tremendous workload reducer for the flight crews. Older autopilots may lack some features found in new autopilot which enable it to work more seamlessly with newer navigation system to enable fully coupled IFR approaches.

b. Glass Cockpit: A glass cockpit is composed of multiple electronic LCD display screens which present aircraft instrumentation and navigation information to the flight crew in an easier to read manner.

Rationale: Older instrument panels are populated with a variety of instrumentation scattered across the panel. The overall reliability of the instrumentation is somewhat less than that of a glass cockpit due to the reduced number of components and increase reliability of the newer LCD displays over older instrumentation. Glass cockpits lend themselves to upgrades via software updates making modifications somewhat easier compared to older, analog instrumentation installations where instruments and warning lights would have to be physically relocated on the panel. Some new navigation capabilities like moving map displays are not possible without electronic displays.

c. Selective Calling (SELCAL): SELCAL is a feature of HF radio which alerts the pilot to an incoming call from ATC. It is not an ATC requirement.

Rationale: When navigating over long distances, flight crews have to monitor the HF radio audio for any calls from ATC directed to their aircraft. This requires the crew to listen to hours of radio static to monitor ATC for these calls. A SELCAL box allow the flight crew to not have to listen to this static. When a call from ATC goes out to our specific aircraft tail number, the SELCAL box alerts the crew to the presence of an incoming HF radio call so the crew can answer without having to monitor the on-frequency radio static for all that time when there is no call.

d. Satellite Communications (SATCOM): Satcom is a BLOS communication system for ATC which has superior audio quality to HF radio. ATC requires some form of BLOS communications when flying in remote areas beyond VHF range. HF is acceptable, but SATCOM is generally preferred.

Rationale: SATCOM provides better audio quality compared to HF. SATCOM requires a subscription to a service provider which can be quite expensive. The same hardware which enables BLOS coms with ATC can also be used to provide the cabin passengers with satellite telephone service as well as digital communication to access e-mail and other internet services. 

e. Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV): LPV is a Flight Management System (FMS) capability which requires an SBAS enabled GNSS system to provide ILS like guidance to an airport which has no ILS system installed.

Rationale: The terrestrial portion of ILS systems are expensive. A single ILS to one runway can cost as much as $1M and it requires constant monitoring and periodic maintenance. Consequently, they are only installed at the biggest and busiest airports. An aircraft with an SBAS enabled GNSS, such as WAAS GPS, EGNOS GPS, or EGNOS Galileo, has the positional accuracy and reliability to execute ILS like approaches to ILS like minimums to airfields with no terrestrial navigational aids installed. This reduces the cost to the air navigation service provider and enables approaches to low minimums to small airfields at greatly reduced costs. An airfield would have to have a charted approach to take advantage of this technology and the approach would have to be included on the non-corruptible database installed in the FMS. Currently, only airfields in the US, Canada, and Europe offer this capability thanks to WAAS and EGNOS. The service volume of EGNOS includes Northern Africa, but unless an airfield has a charted approach to LPV minimums, the capability cannot be used.

f. Controller Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC): CPDLC is essentially text messaging between the flight crew and ATC. CPDLC is enabled by a communications manager and either a VHF radio or Satellite radio. Digital message are composed and received on a display panel in the cockpit which is usually the FMS. Eurocontrol Mandates this service for aircraft which fly above FL290, but it is not required by aircraft which fly below FL 290. Equipping for CPDLC requires the aircraft&rsquo;s Cockpit Voice Recorder record the digital communications in addition to the voice communications.

Rationale: Congested airspace such as that which exists in Europe makes placing and receiving radio calls to ATC difficult at times. There is a limited number of VHF frequencies available for voice communications for ATC so the volume of traffic on each frequency can be quite large. CPDLC allows the transmission and reception of digital message over the same frequencies and enable messages to be targeted to specific recipients. This reduces the amount of voice traffic on frequency and provides ATC instructions in written form which prevents the need to &ldquo;Say Again&rdquo; when the message is not completely understood. This is especially true for communications between pilots and controllers for which English is not their first language. Pilots and controllers may have an unusual, or difficult to understand accent when speaking English which is the required language for air traffic control.  Although use of CPDLC is not mandated below FL290, it is available which may make pilot to controller communications more clear and efficient.

5. WARRANTIES: Supply warranties with start and expiration dates for parts that require warranties.

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Combined Synopsis/Solicitation

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns and operates a Beechcraft King Air B300Cer SN FM-21, registration N68RF. The aircraft (King Air B300Cer SN FM-21) is based at NOAA&rsquo;s Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) Lakeland, Florida and is primarily operated as an Optical Surveillance Platform. This aircraft is tasked with collecting critical data for Coastal Mapping Surveys and performing National Emergency Response Missions after large wide spread disasters (hurricane, tornado, flooding&hellip;). The Emergency Response mission provides vital information in near real time for use by the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) and other Local Emergency Managers to make key decisions. This is the only aircraft that is capable of collecting large scale imagery at a moment&rsquo;s notice at high speed, making this aircraft a vital national asset.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

	NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)


The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:


	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.
	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.
	Identify constraints in transparency and process.





	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.





	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer&rsquo;s decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.





	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman&rsquo;s authority, for instance:





	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).
	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.
	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.
	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA&rsquo;s agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).



	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.
	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.
	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.

f156de7f3d1e861c75e0171d24cfbb74,35043,MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION for FAA Aircraft Acquisition,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Program Operations (AJF) Service Unit contemplates an aircraft acquisition to standardize the Flight Program Operations current fleet of aircraft.   This market survey will support the first phase of the contemplated acquisition for four used (4) Bombardier Challenger 605/650s over a two (2)-year time period.

The purpose of this market survey/RFI is for the FAA to obtain market research and determine industryâ€™s capability to provide four used Bombardier Challenger 605/650s.  Responses to this market survey will be used to improve the FAAâ€™s understanding of the current market and assist with determining the appropriate acquisition strategy and approach.  The nature of competition for this acquisition has not been determined at this time. 

The following principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is being considered:

336411 - Aircraft Manufacturing

1.  BACKGROUND
The FAAâ€™s Flight Program Operations service unit is responsible for all aspects of FAA Flight Program safety, administration, operations, training, and maintenance. The Flight Program Operations service unit conducts four missions:

  â€¢  Flight Inspection: Flight Program Operations ensures the integrity of instrument approaches and airway procedures that constitute our NAS infrastructure and addresses the Agencyâ€™s international commitments. Flight Program Operations accomplishes this mission through the airborne inspection of all space and ground-based instrument flight procedures and the validation of electronic signals in space transmitted from ground navigation systems. Flight Program Operations also performs inspections for the Department of Defense (DOD) as essential to the defense of the United States both foreign and domestic.

  â€¢  Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) Support: Flight Program Operations conducts flight and ground testing directly related to research, development, test, and evaluation of new electronic aids, air traffic procedures, aircraft improvement, and aviation medical research.

  â€¢  Critical Event Response/Transportation: Flight Program Operations provides transportation required to accomplish official FAA responsibilities in times of emergency or disaster (hurricane response), as well as support the NTSB in carrying out its duties. Flight Program Operations also serves the transportation needs of DOT and FAA senior executives, and other federal agencies under reimbursable agreements, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

  â€¢  Aviation Safety Training: Flight Program Operations provides formal training and currency/proficiency services to aviation safety inspectors and flight test personnel to ensure they remain qualified and current to operate FAA aircraft.

Flight Program Operations is responsible for operating and maintaining a fleet of aircraft to accomplish these missions.  The current fleet is comprised of 40 aircraft (twelve makes/models) with an average age of 23 years, including King Air 300, Lear 60, Challenger 601, Challenger 604, Challenger 605, King Air C90GTi, Bombardier Global Express, and Citation 560XL aircraft.

The FAA contemplates transitioning to a multiple-use aircraft strategy to decrease the number of makes and models.  The FAA assessed the current fleet based on mission, airframe age, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance history, as well as workforce composition and training to determine the recommended make-up of the future fleet.

The FAA contemplates a procurement for four (4) used Bombardier Challenger 605s or 650s via an Indefinite Delivery/Requirements contract to supplement the current fleet of Challenger 605 aircraft.   The FAA has determined that Bombardier Challenger 605/650 meet the the requirement.  This determination is based on the significant investment in operations (pilot) and maintenance training, parts, and tooling, as well as engineering data and support already in place for this airframe which allows the FAA to significantly modify the aircraft (including installation of components that require skin penetration) necessary to meet the FAA mission. The FAA plans to procure Bombardier Challengers over a two (2) year period based on availability of funding and market availability.  The FAA will modify the Challenger 605/650 aircraft to meet multiple FAA mission requirements.  

The requirements for the Bombardier Challenger 605s or 650s are included in Attachment A to this Market Survey.

RFQ SUBMISSION
This announcement will close at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on March 27, 2019.
Addendum to 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Oct 2018)
1)	Inquiries - Inquiries and all correspondence concerning this solicitation document should be submitted in writing to James Rall, at james.rall@noaa.gov, and Andrew Hildebrandt, at andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov, by 2:00 EST on March 18, 2019.  The Government is not required to provide responses to vendor's inquiries or correspondence.
2)	Quotation Preparation
The following instructions apply for the submission of quotes:
a.	Quotes shall be submitted in three (3) separate volumes:  Volume I - Past Performance  Volume II - Technical Volume III - Price
b.	The technical volume shall NOT contain any reference to price.  It is incumbent upon the Quoter to provide a technical volume in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise presentation that includes, but is not limited to, the technical requirements of the RFQ.
c.	The Government will evaluate quotes in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in FAR 52.212-2 of this RFQ.
3)	Quote Instructions
a.	Past Performance:Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the vendor to successfully meet the requirements of this solicitation. Vendors are required to provide information on no more than three (3) of the firm's most recently completed contracts/orders (not to exceed three (3) years since completion) for like or similar work. Vendors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.
Each Quoter shall submit, in writing, information on past performance (10 page limit). Quoters shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  In addition, the Quoter is required to send Attachment 02, Past Performance Questionnaire, to those government and commercial activities provided by the Quoter in their submission.  The information shall be completed by the references who will then forward the completed questionnaires to the following:
James Rall james.rall@noaa.gov (Cc andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov)  U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA/ERAD
The Government will not accept Questionnaires directly from the Quoter.  Only Questionnaires submitted on time and from the Quoter's references will be accepted.
The Government will conduct a past performance evaluation based upon the past performance of the vendor as it relates to the probability of vendor to provide the Government with quality service as covered within the solicitation.
Quoters are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS); Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) reports, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity System (FAPIIS), or past performance information from any source.
The burden of providing thorough, complete, and demonstrated relevant past performance information rests with the Quoter.  Any Past Performance Questionnaire(s) received at the Government office designated herein after the exact time specified for receipt of past performance information is ""late"" and may not be considered for evaluation.  If the Quoter possess no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state so in the quote.
Quotes lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the submission with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous submission to the Government when compared to the submissions of other Quoters having a satisfactory (or better) past performance.
b.	Technical: Each Quoter shall submit a technical submission (10 page limit). The technical submission should be sufficiently specific, detailed and complete so as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the Quoter has a thorough understanding of the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW) and has the ability to perform the work.  Quotes which merely state that requirements are understood and will be complied with, which paraphrase the specification document, the SOW or parts thereof, or use phrases such as ""standard consulting practices will be employed"", or ""well established techniques will be employed"", etc., may be considered unacceptable.  The technical submission shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
i.	Experience: Provide demonstrated experience in performing the services listed in the SOW, to include the amount of similar work accomplished in the last 12 months.
ii.	Warranty: Explain warranty on parts, products, and services.
iii.	Planning: Provide a plan for conducting on-site dynamic balancing.
iv.	Delivery: Provide the number of days required for normal overhaul of a propeller, from date of receipt to date of completion, and provide stock levels and pricing for new propeller units, covered in the SOW, and delivery timeline.
v.	Location: Manageable locations that represent the major NOAA deployment locations for the aircraft covered by the SOW (i.e. to include but not limited to areas near: Tampa, Mid-Atlantic Coastal Region, Coastal Gulf of Mexico, Minneapolis, Seattle, Manitoba/Canada).
c.	Price: The Quoter shall submit all information required for the line items included within this solicitation.  The quoted prices for the line items will be added together and used for evaluation purposes to determine the best value to the government over the base year, inclusive with each subsequent option year, over the life of the contract. The quoted prices will also be used to determine reasonableness. 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Jan 2017)(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following non-price factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:
&bull;	Past Performance &bull;	Technical
Past Performance is the most important factor.  Past Performance and Technical, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not award at significantly higher prices to only achieve slightly better performance. The Government will assess the benefits or better performance versus the added price through trade-off analysis. As non-price factors become equal-price becomes increasingly important.
(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

IntroductionThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA.  Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA's prioritized airborne requirements.
PurposeThe purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about the capability and availability of purchasing one (1) multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft, with necessary modifications, to replace NOAA/AOC's Gulfstream Turbo Commander, AC695A aircraft, with the option to purchase a second multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft to support NOAA/OMAO's national mission.  The purchased aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's King Air 350CER (serial number FM21) for safety and standardization.
BackgroundThe aircraft of the NOAA/AOC are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's environment.  NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around the world over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic pack ice.  These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data essential to their research.
The AOC provides capable, mission-ready aircraft and professional crews to the scientific community wherever and whenever they are required. Whether studying global climate change or acid rain, assessing marine mammal populations, surveying coastal erosion, investigating oil spills, or improving hurricane prediction models, the AOC flight crews continue to operate in some of the world's most demanding flight regimes.
The AOC operates and maintains a Gulfstream Turbo Commander (AC695A, serial number 96089), a highly modified twin turboprop aircraft, supporting NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NWS works to provide weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enchantment of the national economy.  Manufactured in 1984, the airframe is over 30 years old and due to aging costs, standardization issues, and loss of mission readiness, OMAO is seeking to replace this aircraft.
The AOC also operates and maintains a Hawker-Beechcraft King Air 350CER (B300C, serial number FM21), another highly modified twin-turboprop aircraft that was acquired in 2007 (WC133M07CN0231), supporting NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NOS works to observe, understand, and manage our Nation's coastal and marine resources. NOS measures and predicts coastal and ocean phenomena, protects large areas of the oceans, works to ensure safe navigation, and provides tools and information to protect and restore coastal and marine resources.   NOAA's requirements have grown over the past ten (10) years and a single aviation platform cannot support all the flight hours that NOS requests every year.  Additionally, this aircraft serves as a single point of failure for the collection of rapid response damage assessment following storms that impact the United States and its territories and the requirement for a backup aircraft exists for the Nation.  For these reasons, OMAO is seeking to expand its fleet of aircraft.
AOC is replacing the Turbo Commander with a multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft(s) capable of efficiently flying the profiles required by NWS and the other line offices in NOAA.   AOC is also contemplating expanding its fleet and capabilities by acquiring an additional King Air 350.The prospective aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's existing King Air 350CER, serial number FM21, for safety and standardization.  This Sources Sought / RFI is issued to gage industry interest as well as aircraft availability for this requirement.

Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) Urgent Requirement to Replace Optical Glass, located at 7917 Hangar Loop Drive H-5, MacDill Airforce Base, Florida 33621.
Identification Number: WC-133M-16-RQ-0908 (Solicitation) and WC-133M-16-CN-0141 (Award)
1. Identification of the agency and contracting activity (FAR 6.303-2(b)(1)).
The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Eastern Acquisition Division located in Kansas City, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition in support of the OMAO Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) located in MacDill Airforce Base, Florida.
2. The nature and/or description of the action being approved (FAR 6.303-2(b)(2)).
NOAA intends to award a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract to Avcon Industries, Inc. located in Newton, Kansas to make replace optical glass for AOC's King Air aircraft.
3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value) (FAR 6.303-2(b)(3)).
The requirement is to provide the replacement optical glass, to be delivered FOB destination as soon as possible to AOC, MacDill Airforce Base, Florida at the cost of $160,555.00. Urgent delivery of the replacement optical glass will minimize the downtime of the aircraft and allow it to fulfill its critical missions.
4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition (FAR 6.303-2(b)(4)).
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-2(b).
5. A statement demonstrating the unique qualifications of the proposed contractor or the nature of the action requiring the use of the authority (FAR 6.303-2(b)(5)).
The optical glass was installed in the King Air aircraft through an aircraft modification. The holder of the Federal Aviation Administration Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for this aircraft modification is Avcon Industries, Inc. The agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals.
The King Air is a critical Emergency Response asset for NOAA and the Nation. The King Air's optical glass is a critical component for Emergency Response imagery and was recently damaged which was both an unpredictable and unusual occurrence. The glass is on the verge of a complete failure. The aircraft is a primary resource for emergency response efforts and the optical glass is absolutely critical to this mission. Without the optical glass, the aircraft would not be able to provide critical imagery for NOAA and FEMA for response efforts. Serious injury and damage to the Federal Government would be realized without replacing the optical glass as quickly as possible. Therefore unusual and compelling urgency is the reason for sole source award to the glass manufacturer, Avcon Industries.
Since Avcon owns the current STC and is familiar with the configuration of aircraft, they are in the best position to complete this modification in a time-frame suitable to successfully complete the project requirements.
6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies (FAR 6.303-2(b)(6)).
In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(2), a synopsis was not issued for the supplies described herein. Due to the determination that the nature of this work is of unusual and compelling urgency, the Government would have been seriously injured should this work be delayed to allow full and open competition.
7. Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable (FAR 6.303-2(b)(7)).
The Contracting Officer determined that the anticipated price(s) will be fair and reasonable based on recent invoices for similar supplies provided by the Contractor, as well as the subject matter expertise provided by the customer's technical representative.
8. A description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted (FAR 6.303-2(b)(8)).
N/A due to the considerations listed in paragraph six above.
9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition (FAR 6.303-2(b)(9)). All facts have been documented in paragraph five above. There are no additional facts to be reported in this section.
10. A listing of any sources that expressed a written interest in the acquisition (FAR 6.303-2(b)(10)).None. Requirements were not synopsized due to urgency.
11. A statement of any actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition, if subsequent acquisitions are anticipated.
The Government will continue to conduct thorough market research to gauge the marketplace capabilities for future requirements. The Government will seek competition of future acquisitions for these supplies.

This is a market survey for the immediate acquisition of non-recurring engineering support services and software required to integrate an ACSS Model NXT-800 transponder into the ProLine 21 equipped King Air (Be-300).  

The FAA Flight Inspection Be-300 fleet of aircraft is in the process of having the Rockwell-Collins, ProLine 21 Avionics Suite of equipment installed.  The FAA is contemplating a fixed-price contract to include the following line items for this requirement.  

Line Item 0001:  Non-recurring engineering â€“ this includes completion of the Critical Design Review; research, development, identification of functional communication signals, and documentation of these parameters and requirements to ensure functionality and that these components properly communicate through the Control Display Unit (CDU).  This information/display information will be integrated between all the various components to make sure the system will have the ability to capture and process the signals and broadcast the correct ADS-B information to ground based receivers.

Line Item 0002:  CDU-3000 Service Bulletin for 822-0882-267  to -495 (2 per aircraft) for a total of 34 each

Line Item 0003:  IOT-4110 Software (RCPN 810-0053-XXX) (2 per aircraft) for a total of 34 each

Line Item 0004:  MDT-3110 Software (RCPN-810-0042-XXX) for a total of 17

This equipment is proprietary to Rockwell-Collins under Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA01267WI-D.  Rockwell-Collins owns the patents, proprietary data and software applicable to all equipment, components, software, and data required for installation of this proprietary avionics system.  This equipment is required to interface with the Flight Inspection System Equipment AFIS and FIAPA used in the backend of the aircraft to test the navigation system of the National Airspace.  

The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Rockwell-Collins as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and is the only known source that owns the rights to modify its equipment and systems.  The FAA requires the engineering expertise that Rockwell-Collins provides that includes information and data necessary to trouble shoot, analyze, test, identify and determine risk of various anomalies in addition to making necessary corrections to their equipment and/or systems software.  As the OEM, Rockwell-Collins owns the STC to add avionics functionality in the Hawker Beechcraft Models B300/B300c.  Due to the non-recurring engineering effort, this specific effort excludes any Rockwell â€“ Collins third party dealers from meeting this requirement.
