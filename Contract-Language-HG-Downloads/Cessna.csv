Requirements for Commercial Aircraft and Support Items: 




	
	Background 
	



	
	A Partner Nation (PN) previously procured five (5) AC-208 Cessna Caravans through U.S. Foreign Military Sales. The AC-208&rsquo;s were procured to provide the partner with a single, organic asset that can find, fix, and finish enemy combatants in one package. The aircraft has similar capabilities to the MQ-9 in terms of finding targets with a high-fidelity targeting pod, launching hellfire missiles at targets, and having an extended loiter time to remain on station. Current operations have shifted away from overt signatures and buildings to personnel hiding in obscure environments.  
	



	
	Upon completion of the upgrade, the PN desires the capability to gain Positive Identification (PID) of individual people with fidelity beyond 1.5 kilometers (km). Current capabilities require the aircrew to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; the target by flying directly overhead. After flying overhead to gain PID (inside the AGM-114 Hellfire minimum launch range), the aircraft must execute a turn away from the target to build enough range for an attack run-in within the hellfire weapons employment zone, at which point the target is no longer visible. This was verified by a senior U.S. pilot (with over 2,000 hours of experience as an evaluator/instructor in fighter and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft) flying onboard the AC-208. Recent missions highlight the PN&rsquo;s desire to use the AC-208 as their primary strike platform, but it is only successfully utilized on targets that can be acquired beyond three nautical miles (e.g. 04APR25 VBIED strike). 
	







	
	Details of the Request 
	



	
	The PN requests procurement, integration and installation of the following components onto each of their five (5) AC-208 Combat Caravan light-attack, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) aircraft: 
	



	
	Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) airborne surveillance and reconnaissance turret  
	



	
	Multiple Processing Units (MPU) 
	



	
	Video Switch Matrix Units 
	



	
	7&rdquo; Flip Up Display Monitors 
	



	
	Technical Manuals Updates 
	



	
	Familiarization/Differences Training on Component Upgrades:  
	



	
	2-week training program for 10 individuals, focused on new features and functionalities by the hardware upgrades. The underlying software and system functionality will remain unchanged.  
	



	
	Operational Framework 
	



	
	An assessment of current fleet configuration.     
	



	
	An airworthiness Type Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the equipment being installed. The approval from the FAA is required prior to the installation.  
	



	
	Installation and integration of components onto the aircraft must be performed at the customer&rsquo;s Main Operating Base (MOB) in an austere location. 
	



	
	Customer requires that 80% of the operational fleet (4/5 aircraft) must always be available for operations, so installation must be done sequentially

Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Respondents shall not be obligated to provide the services described herein. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on https://beta.sam.gov/. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.



The Army Fixed Wing (FW) Project Office (PO) is seeking information regarding services to provide worldwide support to the Army&#39;s fixed wing fleet of Transport Aircraft. These services include programmatic, business, technical, and logistical functional support to the fleet. There is no solicitation package available at this time. Since 1974, Army fixed wing aircraft have consisted primarily of commercial derivative aircraft (CDA) that have been militarized in support of unit and customer missions during peacetime, contingency operations, and time of war such as operational support airlift (personnel and limited cargo) and priority air transport (Department of Defense (DoD) and other agency senior leadership). A CDA, as defined by the FW PO, is an aircraft procured by the armed services for which there is a commercial aircraft equivalent that is Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-type certified, (i.e., an off-the-shelf non-developmental item), and that has its serial number listed on an FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet. The Army Transport Aircraft (TA) CDA systems currently in use for transport missions include Beechcraft, Cessna, Fairchild Swearingen and Textron Defense lines of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products and are classified as small in accordance with (IAW) the Army and FAA weight classes. The Government may add other types of TA CDA and Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) systems during the contract performance period; however, the current number of TA aircraft supported is 154. The total number of aircraft the contractor supports may fluctuate during the period of performance resulting in a total increase or decrease by up to 15%. These aircraft are classified IAW the Army and FAA weight classes. The average range of cost over the last three years is between $135 million - $155 million.

l.  DEFINITIONS - As used throughout this contract, the following terms and abbreviations have the meanings set forth below:



a.  Contract.  An agreement that creates a legal obligation.  The elements of a contract are a mutual agreement; between competent parties; for a legal purpose; involving the exchange of legal consideration; and that creates a mutuality of obligation to perform between the parties.  The term contract, as used herein, includes without limitation, formal bilateral contracts, purchase orders, consignment sales agreements, amendments and modifications thereto, as well as other agreements entered into by an authorized Contracting Officer acting within his or her authority.



b.  Contracting Officer.  An individual delegated the authority to legally bind the NAFI by entering into, modifying, administering, and terminating contracts.



c.  Contractor.  Any legal entity that is awarded a contract.  The Contractor is the party responsible for and agrees to furnish supplies and/or services at specified prices/rates and/or to pay the NAFI mutually agreed to commissions and/or fees in conjunction with providing services to NAFI customers under this contract.  Contractor may include, but is not limited to the following terms &quot;vendor,&quot; &quot;seller,&quot; &quot;supplier,&quot; &ldquo;manufacturer,&rdquo; &ldquo;distributor,&rdquo; &ldquo;concessionaire&rdquo; and/or &quot;licensee.&quot; 



d.  Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative (COR).  An individual authorized in writing by a Contracting Officer to monitor Contractor performance and/or help administer a contract, but does not have authority to legally bind the NAFI into any contractual or legal obligations.

e.  Day.  A day means, unless otherwise provided, a 24 hour period of time denoted as midnight to midnight of a calendar day, unless the last day of a specified number of days within which the contractor must file a claim or notice with the Contracting Officer falls on Saturday, Sunday or a federal holiday, in which case the last day shall be the next business day denoted as Monday through Friday.

    

f.  Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI).  A DoD organizational and fiscal entity supported in whole or in part by Nonappropriated Funds.  A NAFI, as an instrumentality of the U.S. Government, enjoys the same immunities and privileges as the U.S. Government in the absence of specific Federal statute.  It is not incorporated under the law of any State, but has the legal status of an instrumentality of the United States.  References to United States, the Government, and other related references will generally be implied to mean the NAFI throughout this contract.





2.  LEGAL STATUS - The Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI), which is party to this contract, is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. No appropriated funds of the United States shall become due or be paid the Contractor by reason of this contract.



3.  CLAIMS

b.  &quot;Claims,&quot; as used in this clause, means the inability of a Contractor and the Contracting Officer to reach a mutual agreement related to contractual issues in controversy resulting in the filing of a written demand or assertion seeking payment of money, adjustment or interpretation of contract, or other relief, and issuance of a Contracting Officer&rsquo;s final decision.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under this clause.  The submission may be converted to a claim under this clause, by complying with the submission requirements of this clause.  If it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.



(1)  A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the NAFI against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.



(2)  For Contractor claims exceeding $100,000, the Contractor shall submit with the claim a certification that contains the following statement:  &ldquo;Subject to the False Claims Act, 31 USC 3729, I certify the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the NAFI is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify on behalf of the Contractor.&rdquo;



(3)  For contract claims of less than $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.  For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.



c.  The Contracting Officer&rsquo;s decision shall be final unless the contractor appeals as provided in paragraph (d) of this clause.

Decisions of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals are final and are not subject to further appeal.



e.  The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

Except as otherwise specifically provided in this contract, all additions, changes or deletions to this contract must be prepared in writing as a modification and signed either unilaterally by the Contracting Officer or bilaterally by both parties in accordance with applicable regulations.



b.  The Contractor shall not represent itself to be an agent or representative of the NAFI or any other agency or instrumentality of the United States.





5.  ADVERTISEMENTS - The Contractor shall not represent in any manner, expressly or by implication, that items or services purchased or sold under this contract are approved or endorsed by any element of the U.S. Government, including the NAFI.  All Contractor advertisements that refer to the NAFI or a NAFI activity will contain a statement that the advertisement was neither paid for nor sponsored, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government or the NAFI.





6.  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS

7.  HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS - The Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the NAFI and any other agency or instrumentality of the United States, and their officers, agents, and employees, from any loss, expense, damage, injury, claim, suit or judgment (including administrative actions taken against the NAFI by other federal, state or local agencies) arising from the Contractor&rsquo;s (employees, agents or subcontractors) acts or omissions or the items/services provided pursuant to the contract (including any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement claimed by a third party in connection with the items/services provided by the contractor).

The Contractor shall be fully responsible to the NAFI for errors and omissions of its associates and subcontractors under this contract.



b.  The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a current certificate of insurance prior to the commencement of performance under the contract.

The Certificates of Insurance shall evidence that all lines of insurance coverage required by the contract are in effect, and that not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice shall be provided to the Contracting Officer in the event of modification, cancellation, or non-renewal of any portion of the insurance coverage(s).  All certificates of insurance must list the NAFI as the certificate holder, name the NAFI and the United States as additional insureds, and carry an endorsement waiving the Contractor&rsquo;s rights to subrogation against the NAFI and the United States.





9.  PROCUREMENT INTEGRITY

	That no discussion, offer, or promise of future employment or business opportunity has nor will be made to NAFI civilian or military personnel who personally and substantially participated in the contract action.

(2)  That no information proprietary to other offerors or other contracting information (offeror list, prices offered, technical evaluations, rankings, etc.) is sought or obtained until it is available to the public under NAFI procedures.



(3)  That no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to secure this contract for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee except bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial selling agencies retained by the Contractor for the purpose of securing business.

	The Contractor will report in writing to the Contracting Officer any possible violation of this clause when there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation may have occurred.  The Contractor will cooperate fully with any federal agency investigation of a possible violation of this clause.





	For breach of any of these certifications, the NAFI may terminate this contract for default, and/or deduct from amounts due under this or other contracts, or charge the Contractor for the total value of any contingent fee, gratuity, kickback or other loss to the NAFI arising out of the breach.

11.  TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI.  If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract&#39;s date.  To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment clauses of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment.  If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.





12.  CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract without further recourse to the other and mutual release of any further obligations.





13. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE

 

      a.  The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs c. and d. below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-



           (1)  Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any extension;

           (2)  Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (however, see paragraph b. below); or

           (3)  Perform any of the other clauses of this contract (however see paragraph b. below).



      b.  The NAFI&#39;s right to terminate this contract under paragraph a. 2. and a. 3. above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.
 

      c.  If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services.  However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.



      d.  Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.  The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.  Examples of such causes include:



           (1)  Acts of God or of the public enemy

           (2)  Act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity

           (3)  Fires

           (4)  Floods

           (5)  Epidemics

           (6)  Quarantine restrictions

           (7)  Strikes

           (8)  Freight embargoes

           (9)  Unusually severe weather



e.  If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any



     (1)  completed supplies, and



     (2)  partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract.  Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.



f.  The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted.  The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property.  Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Claims Clause.  The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.
 

g.  If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.
 

h.  The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.



i.  This contract is automatically terminated for the convenience of the government in the event the NAFI is dissolved.





14.  CHANGES



a. The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract in any one or more of the following: 




	If the requirement is for supplies and/or services:  Drawings, designs, or specifications; method of shipment or packing; description of services to be performed; time of performance (i.e., hours of the day, days of the week, etc.); place of delivery or place of performance of services.
	 
	If the requirement is for concession services (including public private ventures):  Specifications (including drawings and designs); method or manner of performance of work; NAFI-furnished facilities, equipment, materials, services, or site; and/or directing acceleration in the performance of work.
	 
	If the requirement is for transportation services:  Specifications; work or services; place of origin; place of delivery; tonnage to be shipped; and/or amount of NAFI-furnished property.




b.  If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and modify the contract.



c.  The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order; however, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract.



d.  If the Contractor&rsquo;s proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.



e.  If the requirement is for architect-engineer or other professional services, no services for which an additional cost or fee will be charged by the Contractor shall be furnished without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer.



f.  If the requirement is for concession services (including public private ventures), the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within seven (7) days of the occurrence of any event that the Contractor considers a change to the contract that has not been authorized in writing signed by the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor will be deemed to have waived any right to an adjustment if timely notice is not provided to the Contracting Officer as required herein. For purposes of this clause, &quot;event&quot; shall include, but not be limited to, an order or direction by a NAFI or other Government official, a contested contract interpretation, interference with or interruption of the contract work, or any other event that increases the cost or time to perform the contract as compared to the cost or time that would be required if the Contractor performed the contract in accordance with its terms.



g.  Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a &ldquo;claim&rdquo; under the &ldquo;Claims&rdquo; clause of this Contract; however, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the Contract as changed.

a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:
1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.
2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that theGovernment may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.
3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.
b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her.Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.
c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.
d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:
1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-176 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).
2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.
3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.
4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.

6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, theDepartment of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.
7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).
e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.
f.  The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.
g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.

This aircraft currently has a Honeywell Primus 1000  Avionics Suite installed. For the upgrade The Forest Service would prefer a Garmin G1000 or G3000 package installed but it is known that there are no STCs being developed for this aircraft using the afore mentioned equipment.   That is the basis for this RFI.  The Primus 1000 Autopilot is an adequate Auto Pilot and has been trouble free for Forest Service mission.  One option is to have a system built around the existing Primus 1000 Autopilot using Garmin equipment if possible.  The US Forest Service desires new Flat Panel Screens with AHRS and new air data units.   Dual Garmin GTN 750s approved for LPV coupled approaches, mounted side by side to avoid repositioning of the engine instruments is highly desireable.  A new GDL 69A XM and Nexrad Sat receiver coupled to the MFD is desired. Also needed is a new VP Radar and a new Radar Altimeter, with a TCAS II / ADS-b in and dual compatible Mode S transponders having ADS-b out. The Forest Service would also like the existing DMEs interfaced into the new system.  SVT(synthetic vision technology), SAR(Search And Rescue software which works great for mapping a fire), and Video unlock cards will be needed.  All of the standard paperwork ie: FAA Forms 337 and STC paperwork with an aircraft weigh performed and new weight and balance and equipment list documented with all required Flight Manual Supplements is required. The US Forest Service operates 14 CFR part 91 but meets most 14 CFR part 135 Standards per Forest Service Policy.   Suggestions for optional equipment are appreciated and welcome.  This aircraft is certificated under 14 CFR part 25 and is flown with two pilots.
 
This RFI (request for information) is Market research to find out what is available for this particular aircraft and no more.  If there is sufficient interest in our aircraft then an RFQ (request for quote) will follow shortly followed by an award for the task.  The aircraft can be easily seen on the internet by doing a search for N144Z.

This Performance-Based Services Contract includes on-site activities in Afghanistan required to maintain safe, reliable aircraft for use by United States (US) Air Advisors and the Afghan Air Force (AAF).  Afghanistan is an austere location and offerors should not expect full Continental United States (CONUS)-style accommodations.  This contract also identifies services and establishes activities required for logistics, maintenance, technical order library management, supply chain management, and maintenance training to support daily operations of 24 Cessna C-208B Light Lift aircraft, one (1) Maintenance Training Device (MTD), and an option for one (1) Cessna C-208B Aircrew Training Device (ATD) at Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA).  This contract also includes the requirement for the offeror to train and qualify the AAF to perform the offeror's assigned functions.  The offeror shall train the AAF, via fully documented skill-level training and accompanying apprenticeship requirements, in: transitioning/standing-up logistics, supply chain management, technical order library management, and maintenance capabilities to maintain airworthy aircraft and option year sustainment capabilities.  This contract's end-state is to train the AAF such that they are self-sufficient in the operations and maintenance tasks included in this contract so that the USG can transfer maintenance responsibility to the AAF.

See PWS paragraph 1.2.2.
4. Describe your approach to performing maintenance of AAF responsible aircraft IAW PWS paragraph 3.2.4.

Please provide your concerns, if any, to the following scenarios for relocating from Kandahar to another coalition base in a region.
Scenario #1: All nine (9) C208B aircraft located at Kandahar will move to the new base, along with tools, support equipment, and contractor personnel.
