The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to manufacture this item.  Firms interested in participating in this procurement are encouraged to contact the OEM to inquire about the data or rights to the data.



In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.



Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.



It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the procurement described make contract with the firms listed. 



This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).



Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the supplies or services described. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government&#39;s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.



Government&#39;s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer



Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.sam.gov.



Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. 



This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.



Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.



Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 855-3552.

This product will be provided by EDGEONE LLC located at 4 Little Brook Road West Wareham, Massachusetts 02576.

NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson deploys and recovers scientific moorings. All moorings utilize EdgeTech hydroacoustic releases, requiring the EdgeTech acoustic command/ranging deck box. New hydroacoustic releases are not designed to work with our current, older model, hydroacoustic command/ranging deck box.  

Currently, both older models and new models of the releases are being used in the field, requiring the new deck box model.  It is the CST&rsquo;s understanding the new deck box model will work with old and new hydroacoustic releases.   

The 8011M Edge Tech Acoustic Command/Ranging Deck Unit properties and engineering design specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by another manufacturer. EDGEONE LLC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the equipment. Therefore, the government intends to negotiate directly with EDGEONE LLC avoiding unnecessary mark ups, delay, warranty, and delivery issues.

The Government is not aware of any other authorized vendors that can provide this specialized equipment while also meeting all of the requirements/concerns listed above. The intended procurement is to acquire one 8011M Edge Tech Acoustic Command/Ranging Deck Unit.

The Government intends to acquire this part under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with EDGEONE LLC. under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with a business size standard of 1350 employees. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any interested party that is an authorized distributor, re-seller, dealer from EDGEONE LLC. and can provide the above requirement, at no additional mark ups, without compromising manufacturing, delivery and warranty may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by August 11, 2025 at 5:00 PM EST. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

0dc188abc35b4f8e8e989a2b796f1a92,F1S0AY5125A002,Notice of Intent to Sole Source (NOCA) - Strain Gauges,"The Air Force Test Center (AFTC) intends to solicit and award a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Contract to VISHAY MEASUREMENTS GROUP INC, 951 Wendell BLVD Wendell, North Carolina 27591-9515, United States. IAW 5.203(a)(1), the anticipated award date is on or before Jul 25, 2025. The applicable NAICS is 334419 with a size standard of 750 employees. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 United States Code (USC) 2302(b), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) and AFFARS 5313.501. The following is a brief description of the proposed contract action: The Vishay Measurement Group strain transducers are essential to capturing accurate strain data necessary for validating structural loads, flight envelope safety, and aerodynamic performance. Key performance attributes include: Precise strain sensitivity and calibration stability across varying temperatures and timeframes; Electrical compatibility with aircraft-specific data acquisition and signal conditioning systems; Physical adaptability to diverse mounting geometries tailored to individual test articles; And sustained reliability under conditions of high vibration, elevated temperatures, and dynamic structural loading. The required strain gages are produced exclusively by Vishay Measurement Group, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specified in the aircraft&rsquo;s design and airworthiness documentation. The aircraft in question are owned and controlled by the prime contractor, Northrop Grumman, and the 420th CTF does not have configuration control. This means only the original, OEM-specified parts may be used without invalidating the aircraft&rsquo;s flight worthiness certifications. Any deviation from the specified Vishay parts would trigger significant operational and financial consequences, including but not limited to: Redesign and recertification of aircraft electrical and mechanical subsystems by Northrop; Reworking sensor wiring and replacing interface components already installed; Procurement of alternative connectors, terminations, and integration hardware; Airworthiness re-approvals across multiple oversight channels; Delays in flight test schedules and program milestones, which could cost the Government tens of millions of dollars in cascading schedule impacts and lost readiness. Given these constraints, substitution is not acceptable, and no other manufacturer&rsquo;s parts will satisfy the Government&rsquo;s minimum needs. There are no solicitation documents; however, any vendors that believe they can meet the requirements described should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the requirement. In addition, the response should include verification of the Offeror Representation and Certifications--Commercial Items in accordance to FAR 52.212-3. If the offer does not have a copy of this provision, go to http://www.sam.gov/ to load the required information. Any response received without completing this registration will be considered noncompliant. Further, the response should include any special requirements for a commercial contract (i.e. Commercial Financing, Warranty Provisions, Delivery Information, etc.) in accordance with FAR part 12. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government representative to evaluate and determine if it can meet the requirement. Responses must be received no later than (NLT) 1130, Pacific Date Time, 25 July 2025. Responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, 1st Lt Austen Siegler at austen.siegler.1@us.af.mil.

	Contract Opportunity Type: Sources Sought


Classification


	Original Set Aside: N/A
	Product Service Code: 1550


Description

Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) for the United States Army

Product Service Code:

15 - AEROSPACE CRAFT AND STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS

NAICS Code: 336411 &ndash; Aircraft Manufacturing.

336413 &ndash; Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing.

334511 &ndash; Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.

334290 &ndash; Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing.

Place of Performance: Army Contracting Command &ndash; Redstone, 5303 Martin Road Sparkman Center, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, USA

Purpose: This Sources Sought is for market research purposes to assess Small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (SUAS) candidates, and evaluate the commercial industrial base to achieve production scale to quantities in the thousands. Responses to this Sources Sought may be used to make informed decisions regarding future procurement requirements, therefore the UAS must be 2020 NDAA Sec 848, 2023 NDAA Sec 817 and American Security Drone Act of 2023 (2024 NDAA, PL 118-31, DIV A, Title XVIII, Subtitle B, SEC. 1821) compliant or demonstrate a path to compliance.

Details: The Army, through the Program Executive Office (PEO), Aviation, is seeking vendors with solutions that deliver the following:


	Unit cost for air vehicle less than $2,000.00.
	Additional dependent equipment to include ground control station/controller, communications equipment, goggles, batteries, and charging station for one to many controllers to UAS. Cost for these items will be fairly considered during response evaluation.
	Production capability to deliver an initial quantity of systems by 30 September 2025 with the ability to quickly ramp production and deliver larger quantities up to 10,000 air vehicles within 12 months.
	The ability for our Soldiers to modify, within reason, the system with a variety of third-party payloads, armaments, and munitions without vendor involvement
	The ability for our Soldiers to repair the system without vendor involvement



Intent: The Army requires low-cost UAS for immediate fielding with up to 10,000 air vehicles within 12 months. The ability to deliver systems at or below our threshold cost is the primary weighted measure.  The system performance characteristics will distinguish systems meeting this core requirement.  The production capability as well as the ability for Soldiers to modify and repair are additional distinguishing characteristics. The intent for modifications is to ensure Soldiers are able to add simple payloads (such as 30mm mortars, grenades, or other lethal payloads) and non-lethal capabilities based on mission needs without vendor involvement in the field. These systems may also be utilized as targets during Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) training and other training exercises. Likewise, Soldier repair is needed to allow units to fully understand their equipment and stay in the fight while waiting for additional systems / spare components. 

This Sources Sought is intended to complement the Government&rsquo;s understanding from the recently released Sources Sought Notification for Purpose Built Attritable Systems (PBAS), published on 16 April 2025 requirements. This Sources Sought focuses more on cost without the constraints of performance, payloads, and other requirements in the previous announcement.  The goal of this Sources Sought is to deliver low- cost UAS solutions into Army formations rapidly and reduce &ldquo;gold plating.&rdquo; The Army must expand UAS production capacity across the industrial base. Funding is available to achieve this capacity expansion.

Request: The Government encourages interested parties to respond. Interested parties should fill out the accompanying Response Template in its entirety. Interested parties may also submit a one (1) page white paper that provides additional detail about your solution.

The Government will assess the vendor responses and may invite select vendors to demonstrate current capabilities and submit additional details. Vendor demonstrations will include the full range of system capabilities.

a93bf0ba4dd94362b03673c3088276a6,80GSFC25R7015,Space weather Observations at L1 (SOL) Series X-ray Irradiance Sensor (XRIS),"Pre-Solicitation Notice for Space weather Observations at Lagrange 1 (SOL) X-ray Irradiance Sensor (XRIS)

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plan to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Space weather Observations at Lagrange 1 (SOL) X-Ray Irradiance Sensor (XRIS) instrument.

SOL is a high priority joint undertaking by NASA and NOAA. Two SOL Observatories will provide NOAA with the continuity of solar wind data, Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) imagery, and the second observatory will provide X-ray irradiance data from the XRIS instrument.

The X-ray Irradiance Sensor (XRIS) instrument will be used to measure the energy power from solar radiation per unit area to detect changes in solar activity, like solar flares, and help predict solar energetic particle events that can penetrate the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. The instrument will monitor X-ray flares that can cause changes in the Earth&rsquo;s ionosphere such as strong radio bursts that may interfere with radio frequencies and cause problems for satellite communication and navigation systems. Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are sometimes associated with solar flares which can lead to geomagnetic storms.

SOL will procure one (1) flight and one (1) spare XRIS instrument that will provide NOAA with the continuity and resilience of space weather observations for the X-ray irradiance. The X-ray irradiance measurement is a high availability (HAP) product, which is one of the National Weather Service&rsquo;s highest priorities for space weather observations. The continuation of these observations is essential for space weather predictions and the creation of actionable warnings for the protection of critical infrastructure that includes different sectors in the nation like aviation, commerce, energy, space exploration, and defense. XRIS will fly on the second observatory, SOL-B, which is targeted to launch in October 2032.

The contract scope includes those tasks necessary to design, analyze, develop, and fabricate one (1) flight and one (1) spare XRIS instrument. The Statement of Work defines the tasks necessary to integrate, test, calibrate, evaluate, support launch, perform on-orbit check-out of the X-Ray Irradiance Sensors, supply and maintain the instrument Ground Support Equipment (GSE), Ground Processing Algorithms, and support the Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) through mission hand over to NOAA.

The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

This procurement will be conducted as a full and open competition.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and Size Standard are 336414 and 1,330, respectively.

It is anticipated that this competitive procurement will result in a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) hardware contract with severable funding for two (2) X-Ray Irradiance Sensors: one (1) flight and one (1) spare.

The overall period of performance of the contract is anticipated to be from the date of contract award through January 2034 (fifteen (15) months after launch of the second mission, which is anticipated to be October 2032) for a total of approximately 8 years. The period of performance for the contract includes operational handover to NOAA of the final instrument. The handover to NOAA will happen after successful launch, post launch evaluation, calibration, data validation, and on-orbit anomaly investigations. The first flight model shall be delivered by June 2029 and the second by December 2029.

The Draft RFP will be posted for information and planning purposes. No proposal is requested, and no contract will be awarded as a result of the Draft RFP. Potential Offerors are invited to comment on all aspects of the solicitation including the requirements, proposal instructions, and evaluation approach. If your comments include recommendations for revisions, you must provide your rationale for such revisions. The timeline for comments to the Draft RFP will be specified in the Draft RFP Cover Letter.

This synopsis shall serve as the pre-solicitation notice for the Draft RFP.

NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf

706335a90e99471386dd52caf9c22f1e,140G0325Q0119,19--FLOATING BARGE WITH FIN ANTENNA,"Synopsis:The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Colombia River Research Laboratory requires floating PIT-tag detection arrays with transceivers that can detect 134.2 kHz Full- and Half-duplex PIT tags and can power multiple antennas. Two floating arrays are desired downstream of Foster Dam to provide route specific data for juvenile salmonid passage. Best design for these two arrays is a barge with fin antennas. Fin antennas are oriented vertically in the water column and can pivot upward to shed debris or for maintenance. Fins should be capable of being raised and lowered remotely. The barge itself should be a platform for housing transceiver controls and power. One floating array is desired downstream of Green Peter Dam. Due to the shallow nature of the river, a fin system is not practical, but a floating matrix antenna array can operate at the range of water depths at this site due to rapid changes in dam discharge. Transceiver control and power system will be shore mounted for the matrix antenna and the transceiver control and wiring should allow for possible expansion to additional matrix or bottom mounted antennas. The arrays we require at both sites need to be designed and equipped to deploy from a cross-channel skyline with ability to move laterally for maintenance or prevention of flood damage.The USGS is contemplating a single, firm-fixed price order in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13.5, entitled, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons (PEO (U&amp;W)), Navy and Marine Corps Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program Office (PMA-263) at Patuxent River, MD is seeking industry input to identify potential solutions for a UAS to be used by an international partner for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and search and rescue operations remaining on station for up to 48 hours. The system needs to be able to operate in static rain environments up to 1 inch per hour, conduct wide area surveillance, cued response with localized search, vessel classification, identification and tracking. The system should be ready to use, as delivered, with minimal logistics, training, and other support. The system should provide real-time full motion video via electro-optical and infrared sensors (EO/IR), with the ability to detect and monitor large and small objects in the water (i.e. small vessels, people) distinguish between vessel types (i.e. fishing, merchant, tanker, state). The Air Vehicles (AV) should be capable of autonomous or safe manual launch and recovery, independent of runways.  The Ground Control Station (GCS) should be man-portable and consist of the necessary equipment to monitor the sensor(s) position and status, control its movement and view its video.

The PHOMI is planned to fly on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) SWGEO program satellites. NASA seeks information on instrument concepts for photospheric magnetograph imagers capable of producing Line of Sight (LOS) measurements of the photospheric magnetic field. High resolution mapping of the solar photospheric magnetic field is a critical input to model the solar wind velocity, density, and magnetic polarity. In addition to magnetic field measurement, doppler velocity observations are also of interest. While only LOS observations are required, if capabilities could be extended to vector measurements, the Government would be looking to understand and have potential offerors describe any impacts on the sensor Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP), cost, and risk.

If awarded, the Government anticipates awarding up to four Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contracts, each valued at approximately $1.5 million with a potential 12 month period of performance (one nine-month Base Period and one three-month Option Period).

The Government anticipates releasing a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) during May 2025. This will be an opportunity for potential offerors to provide questions, comments, or concerns regarding the DRFP. The Government will not accept any proposals or offers for the DRFP.

The Government anticipates releasing a Final Request for Proposal (RFP) during June 2025 with an anticipated offer due date 30 days after release.

The Government does not intend to award a resultant contract using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services).

This procurement will be a Full and Open Competition with no anticipated Small Business goals for this procurement.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 with a Size Standard of $25.5 million.

All responsible sources may submit an offer when applicable, which shall be considered by NASA GSFC. NASA FAR (NFS) clause 1852.215-84 (Ombudsman) is applicable. The GSFC Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.nasa.gov/ombuds-office/ombuds-contact-us/.

0888d09263854eca95a2d2af426bbdba,NASA-GSFC-LISA-ETU-Telescope,Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Engineering Test Unit (ETU) Telescope,"NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center has a requirement for the design, development, fabrication, alignment, testing, verification, delivery, and associated post-delivery support services for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Engineering Test Unit (ETU) telescope. As part of its contribution to the European Space Agency (ESA)-led mission, NASA GSFC will deliver the LISA ETU telescope to ESA, which is required to efficiently transfer laser power between optical benches across 2.5 million kilometers in order to transfer enough laser light between spacecraft.  

NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center intends to issue a sole source contract to acquire the items and services from L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (L3Harris) under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, &ldquo;Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&rdquo;

L3Harris involvement with LISA began with the LISA Study Office design study in 2018, which was issued to multiple industry partners through a task under NASA&rsquo;s Mechanical Integration Services and Technologies (MIST) contract. The purpose of the study was to examine the Government&rsquo;s strawman optical and mechanical design and requirements, assess how it could be built, supply a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate, and a list of risks for building the Structural Thermal Model (STM) and the Engineering Development Unit (EDU) telescopes. The information gained from the study led to a competitive procurement to produce the STM and the EDU telescopes for LISA. L3Harris was awarded NASA GSFC contract 80GSFC20C0056 in 2020 for the development of the LISA STM and EDU telescopes. L3Harris&rsquo; first telescope in the EDU telescope development program was the STM. It successfully demonstrated the telescope build process and verified that the design and material met the very demanding LISA stability requirements. The second telescope, known as EDU1, was built to meet all LISA requirements, and demonstrated excellent optical performance. L3Harris successfully demonstrated that an all-glass telescope that met the extremely demanding LISA performance requirements could be built.

Leveraging the existing procedures, equipment, and facilities at L3Harris will enable the Government to design, test, build, and deliver the LISA ETU telescope to ESA on schedule and within the budget constraints that would otherwise be impossible if another vendor was selected either to continue the current design and/or start from scratch with the LISA telescope requirements. A duplication of the resources already spent by NASA dating back to 2018 would cost millions of dollars and take at least another three (3) years to bring another industry partner to the stage of design/development that L3Harris is currently at with the LISA telescope.

To meet the LISA ETU telescope delivery date to ESA, NASA GSFC must continue the development and production of the LISA ETU telescope as soon as possible in order to receive the LISA ETU telescope no later than March 2028.. Failure to deliver the ETU telescope in the required timeframe will result in significant cost impacts that cannot be absorbed by the LISA project. It will additionally result in unacceptable schedule impacts that would be magnified in the flight production phase and ultimately could result in the cancellation of the mission.

The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial product or commercial service using FAR Part 12.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort electronically via email to Contracting Officer Stefan Flessa at stefan.d.flessa@nasa.gov no later than 5:00PM EDT on May 21, 2025. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this acquisition on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.
